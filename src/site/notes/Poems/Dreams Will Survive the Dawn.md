# Dreams Will Survive the Dawn

They say your 20s are the foundation of your future but it often feels like building on shifting sand. I often wonder if the person I am becoming is the one I wanted.

We find ourselves at the crossroads of expectation and desire, searching for a path that feels like our own.

We are constantly negotiating between the person we are and the person we wish to become.

I realise now that growth is less about becoming someone new and more about shedding who I'm not.

Personal growth often comes from the most unexpected experiences.

The pressure to succeed often outweighs the fear of failure.

Memories shape our perception of the present and expectations for the future.

Not all friendships are meant to last, and that's OK.

We often fear the unknown until it becomes familiar.

I stand at the edge of tomorrow wondering which dreams will survive the dawn.
