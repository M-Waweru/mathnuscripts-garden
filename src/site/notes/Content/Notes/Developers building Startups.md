# Developers Building Startups

I like seeing computer science guys building software products and launching startups. We need more people like them in our market. The audacity to just launch a startup. I wish someone would have told us these things back in university. All they did was tell us that we shouldn't build management systems. However, I have come to see that management systems are exactly what most people need from software. The systems just need to be reliable, simple to use and secure. They brushed over these things and that was a shame.

Developers should build more products and launch more startups than they are doing now. They need the skill set to turn market opportunities into products that people will use.
