# Andrew Tate on Elon Musk

In this video on [Andrew Tate on Elon Musk](https://youtu.be/3zmRfvFE58w), it is clear that successful men are define by the fact that they had enough but they chose to do more anyway.

When you have enough, that is when you are tested for passion. The greatest feats of the world where done by men who had enough but chose to do more. Even when they knew that they were biting of more than they could chew. Even when they knew that it came with risks, baggage and even fatal danger. They did it because they believe in more for themselves and the world around them. It is almost like a calling, a divine mission to do what is right and what is necessary. 

Andrew Tate sees this in Elon Musk but there are also other silent heroes that go unmentioned. Men are unspoken heroes who keep the world in balance. The reason that we have not collapsed is because men wake up everyday and do what is necessary. Despite their demons, they wake up and make the world a better place. They expel their energy and receive no gratitude in return. It is what they must do. They have no choice but they choose to do it everyday. Those are the real heroes and they deceive as much respect as Elon Musk and other successful people.
