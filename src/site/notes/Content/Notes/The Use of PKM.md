# The Use of PKM

This is how I plan to use my PKM system to make my life better

1. Sharing my notes selectively
2. Understanding myself and my thoughts
3. Organise my knowledge: both gathered and thoughts
4. Hosting them for reference. On my own server and website
5. Building services for people to make their own digital minds.
6. Using the content for videos, conversations, podcasts, blog posts and anything else that I would like to publish, teach and share
7. Build a living document, system or application that can be navigated to understand Mathenge and what he knew. This is the [[Fleeting Notes/Digital Mind\|Digital Mind]] or [[Fleeting Notes/Exocortex\|Exocortex]]
