# Computers as Molders of the Universe

We think of computers as just garbage-in garbage-out machines. We only think of information in and out.

However, I believe that computers can do more it they interact in the physical world like human beings do. 

In an ideal situation, they can allow us to become actual alchemists by building anything that we design in the real world as a real object. In fact, the vision of having a computer become a computing being is what we are getting at here. It can move in the world like we do. It can even do it better.
