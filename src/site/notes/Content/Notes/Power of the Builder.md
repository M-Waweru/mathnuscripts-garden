# The Power of the Builder

As a builder, the sky is the limit. As long as you can build something in the physical or digital world, people will look for you to do it. You can get all the resources you need if you know what to build, who to build it for and how to built it. 

Software is the frontier and the most productive form of building that we have come up with yet. It is the definition of making money for you while you sleep. It runs tasks, activities and events when you are away and focusing on other things.
