# Operations-as-a-Service

By offering support services as an organisation, SMEs can focus less on the support roles and more on their core business. These services include legal, accounting, finance, web development, videography .etc.

This is quite similar to what IAN is doing right now for startups. We can simply expand this to SMEs as a whole, who can greatly benefit from such services.
