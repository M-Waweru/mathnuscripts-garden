# Zones of Work

Taught by Matt Mochary to top tech entrepreneurs and VCs like Naval.

There are divided into:
1. Zone of Excellence - good at it but don't enjoy it
2. Zone of Genius - good at it and enjoy it
3. Zone of Competence
4. Zone of Incompetence

The goal is to have 80% of your work in your Zone of Genius where you are good at your work and enjoy it.
