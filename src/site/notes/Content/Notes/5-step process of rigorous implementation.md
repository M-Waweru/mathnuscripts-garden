# 5-step process of rigorous implementation

I got these steps from a video where Elon Musk was explaining the steps they take a SpaceX when designing and building something for a rocket.

The video was by Everyday Astronaut and it featured Elon at Starbase.

### 1. Make your requirements less dumb
- Always criticize and test if the requirements are right. No matter who gave them to you.

### 2. Try very hard to delete a part or process
- If you aren't adding new things, you are not deleting enough
- Get rid of extra parts and components that are not essential
- A component or part must have a name of a person, not a department. The person must take charge of it.

### 3. Simplify or optimise
- Engineers tend to optimise things that shouldn't exist. Remove it or simplify it

### 4. Accelerate cycle time
- If you are moving slowly, move faster, but consider the first 3 steps before doing this

### 5. Automate it
- Don't make the mistake of going from step 5 to step 1. Automate is the last step

In production, remove in-process testing if you have finished the debugging process. Do end-process testing.

Everyone must be the chief engineer. They must understand the product at a high-level
