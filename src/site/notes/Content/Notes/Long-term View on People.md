# Long-term View on People

I got this from Steve Jobs in one of his lectures at a university. When an employee makes a mistake, instead of doing it yourself or destroying their confidence, it is best to build them up by letting them figure out the right thing to as you provide guidance. This is a hard message for micro-managers to hear but if Steve Jobs learnt this the hard way, you should learn it too.
