[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI6WUJpnKrA) by Robert Greene

Stupidity is not about intelligence but about actions. 

When we are stupid, we have take action that has unforeseen and negatives consequences

We are stupid, not when we are ignorant, but when we have half-knowledge about something. 

Ignorant people are more cautious because they realise that they don't know something.

Stupid people are very convicted people and they tend to convince people that they are right. Many times, they actually do and lead people down the wrong path. 

Whenever, you are too convicted about something, it means that you are trying to convince yourself that it is the right approach. This is because of have some doubts about the situation but you don't want to face it. This is dangerous and lead you down the wrong path and eventually to loss of time, effort and resources.
