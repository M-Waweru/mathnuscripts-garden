# Things To Do in Your 20s

Based on this [article](https://iamalexmathers.medium.com/14-things-i-wish-i-knew-at-25-now-that-im-38-b9796e9ba574)

1. Become exceptional at one thing
2. Focus on being useful, not on happiness or passion
3. Control your emotions
4. Stop stopping - being consistent and going through the boredom is the game.
5. Leave home - being geographical flexible is a character-builder
6. Don't make decisions that lock you down for decades, unless you are sure. This includes marriage, getting a kid, a mortgage and so on.
7. Trust no-one but be gracious
8. Focus on making other people's lives better. By helping others, you will receive so much in return.
