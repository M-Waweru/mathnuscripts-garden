# PC-Building

In high school, I was obsessed about building a PC.

I knew the components at the tip of my fingers. The main ones were as follows:
1. CPU - Computer Processing Unit
2. GPU - Graphical Processing Unit
3. Motherboard
4. Case
5. PSU - Power Supply Unit
6. CPU Fan
7. Monitor
8. Keyboard
9. Mouse

The other components included:
1. Sound card
2. System fans
3. DVD drive

This is related to [[Fleeting Notes/Subsistence Servers\|Subsistence Servers]] or the [[Home Lab\|Home Lab]]. This is where you build home servers to run personal applications or even enterprise if you would like.

It is also similar to having a data center, where you host your data and other people's data.
