# How Normary Benefitted from its Oil

This is the story of the [[Fleeting Notes/Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund\|Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund]], which combined public-private partnership, competition between foreign companies and taxes to create a wealth fund and an industry that has benefitted the Norwegian people, not just a few individuals.

Norway is an inspiration for resource-rich countries to benefit more sustainably from their resources instead of creating kings and rent seekers of resources that they didn't even produce.

The principles in this scheme are similar to [[Fleeting Notes/Land Value Tax\|Land Value Tax]]
