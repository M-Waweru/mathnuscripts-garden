# Permissionless Economy

Working without being told what do. I have no boss to tell me what I need to say and when to say it.

I can build a community, have authentic conversations and make money while I am at it.

The permissionless economy is about independent individuals working together to help each other grow, based on their own self-interests and expertise. A designer can be in this environment and sell their skills to other individuals or groups in the community.

Communities are:
1. A hacker and innovator community of people looking to build software for the African market. Refer to [[Content/Projects/Hacker Studio\|Hacker Studio]] and [[Visionary Workshop\|Visionary Workshop]]
2. A intellectual community of smart people who want to have niche conversations on philosophy, tech and son. Refer to [[Fleeting Notes/Cerebrations\|Cerebrations]]. Also similar to [[Visionary Workshop\|Visionary Workshop]]
3. A community of content creators looking to create intellectual content in Africa. Refer to [[Intellectual Content in Africa\|Intellectual Content in Africa]]
4. A community of urban dwellers looking to understand and improve rural areas by living and work there to improve our country. Refer to [[Digital Village\|Digital Village]] or [[Startup City\|Startup City]]
5. A community of Africans looking to understand and document their cultures and preserve them for the next generation. Refer to [[Digital Museum\|Digital Museum]]
