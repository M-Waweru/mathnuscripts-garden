# Computing a theory for Everything

[Ted Talk by Stephen Wolfram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60P7717-XOQ)

I searched for Wolfram and I was not disappointed. Understanding the universe and using the knowledge we have gathered to do so is a fascinating concept. Computation is a great force to do such a thing. There is the method of using AI to understand the universe but what if we used a simpler approach that utilises something deeper. Wolfram Alpha is a step in that direction, by creating programs that dissect language and the knowledge we produce to come up with interesting combinations that are innovative and smarter than the AI systems we have today. AI systems require a lot of data but what if you could use less data to produce results. It can be used for private repositories of knowledge and can be deployed from scratch and used by anyone. It is a grand idea that aligned with the digital mind. All digital minds can unique because of the private data that we put into it but they are equally powerful and even more innovative as they have unique perspectives, ideas and principles developed.

This could be the key to understanding our universe and the place we have in it. Instead of a monolithic of an AI, we can have collaborative knowledge-based systems that interact, share and produce new knowledge. This remains true to the principle that all efficient systems should have smaller independent actors.

## Title: Computing as the Theory for Everything 

Stephen Wolfram, an acclaimed computer scientist and physicist, in his groundbreaking video, presents a potentially transformative idea: the notion of computing as the theory for everything. This concept revolves around the utility of computational systems to model and explain all phenomena in the universe.

Wolfram's theory is rooted in the premise that all natural processes and systems can be understood through computational models. He suggests that everything we see around us - from physical phenomena to biological processes, economic trends, social interactions and even human consciousness - can be explained through a computational lens. This is a radical departure from traditional scientific theories which primarily rely on mathematical equations as an explanatory device.

The theory's brilliance lies in its simplicity and universal applicability. Wolfram proposes that simple programs, when iterated over time, can generate complex behavior. These programs operate on fundamental rules or algorithms which dictate their behavior. He uses cellular automata as an example to demonstrate this concept. Cellular automata are simple computational systems that evolve over time based on a set of predetermined rules. Despite their simplicity, they can exhibit highly complex behaviors which mimic those observed in nature.

Wolfram's theory has profound implications for our understanding of the universe. If we accept the premise that everything operates according to simple computational rules, then it suggests a deterministic universe where future states can be predicted based on current conditions and knowledge of these rules.

However, this does not necessarily imply predictability or pre-determinism due to two reasons. Firstly, some systems might operate under such complex rules or initial conditions that predicting future states becomes practically impossible due to computational irreducibility. Secondly, some systems might be sensitive to initial conditions (a feature known as 'chaos'), making accurate long-term predictions difficult.

In addition to these theoretical considerations, Wolfram's idea also promises practical benefits by offering new tools for scientific exploration and discovery. For instance, by using computer simulations and data analysis, scientists can build models to study complex systems ranging from galaxies to human brains, providing insights which might be impossible to obtain through traditional experimental methods.

Moreover, it also has the potential to redefine our approach towards problem-solving. Instead of trying to solve problems analytically or empirically, we can use computational methods to simulate different scenarios and derive solutions.

Despite its far-reaching implications, Wolfram's theory is not without its critics. Some argue that it oversimplifies reality by assuming that all phenomena can be explained through computation. Others question whether it can truly predict real-world behavior given the complexity and randomness inherent in many natural systems.

Regardless of these criticisms, there is no denying that Wolfram's idea of computing as the theory for everything presents a fascinating perspective on the nature of the universe. It invites us to see the world not just as a collection of physical objects but as a vast computational machine operating according to simple rules. This vision provides a new lens through which we can understand and interact with our world, paving the way for scientific breakthroughs and technological innovations.
