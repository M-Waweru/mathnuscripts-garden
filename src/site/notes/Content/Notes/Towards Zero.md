# Towards Zero

Towards zero. Towards Purpose, Towards Oneness. What can I say, I have the urge to find my purpose. What makes me come alive and how can I help others to do the same? Know thyself. That's the most important thing but you are your greatest opportunity and your greatest challenge. You have to know yourself before you can master yourself. Then you can master the world around you and make it better. 

I am inspired by writers like Wait But Why, Nick Bostrom. I am fascinated by Albert Einstein, Leonardo Da Vinci, Elon Musk, Claude Shannon, Alan Turing. People who had intellectual minds and are willing to use them to understand what is unknown and barely understood by others. They walk where many have not and done what many will never do. I want to learn more about these men and I want to become like them.
