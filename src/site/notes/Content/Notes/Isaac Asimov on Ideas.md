# Isaac Asimov on Ideas

You can find a reference to article that inspired these notes [here](https://www.technologyreview.com/2014/10/20/169899/isaac-asimov-asks-how-do-people-get-new-ideas/)

For those who don't know Isaac Asimov, you can find a ChatGPT generates explanation below: 

>Isaac Asimov was an American author and professor of biochemistry best known for his works of science fiction and for his popular science books. Asimov was one of the most prolific writers of all time, having written or edited more than 500 books and an estimated 90,000 letters and postcards. His most famous works are the Foundation Series, the Robot Series, and I, Robot. Asimov's works explore such themes as artificial intelligence, robotics, extraterrestrial life, and nuclear war. He is considered to be one of the "Big Three" science fiction writers along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke.

I have read the article and I am convinced that I have to hold these things regularly. I love ideas but I also want them to be put to action and made to change the world around us. As said in [[Fleeting Notes/Innovation vs. Invention\|Innovation vs. Invention]], invention is only as good as the change in behaviour it creates in people and the world around us.

Have interesting discussions as been my thing for me. I don't like cheap discussions and clueless debates. I want a deep conversation about tough and interesting problems. 

My rules for the engagement:
1. Come prepared to share
2. It is a casual event, don't feel pressure
3. All ideas are welcome
4. Consider an idea's viability before putting it down
5. When an idea is great, note it down
6. When you want to work on an idea, make it a good habit to bounce it with the group. Keep us involved

I have a couple of ideas on how to manage it. Our member data can be stored on the blockchain and we are have rules on how gets to join. I should look into our cults do this stuff. Honestly, I want my own cult right now. [[Fleeting Notes/How to Form a Cult\|How to Form a Cult]]
