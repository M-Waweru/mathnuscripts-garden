# We Really Don't Know How to Compute

[Video](https://youtu.be/HB5TrK7A4pI)

The holy grail of computing is to use a language to create something in the physical world. Just like God spoke and created the heavens and the earth, so shall man create things with their thought. Unparelled power.

The human genome is just 1GB. The language it is written in can build a human being from a single cell. We should be learning from biology on how it does that. Even your brain can recognise patterns in milliseconds that take a computer ages and massive amounts of data and power to pull off.

The challenge we have is that computing hardware is free but there is a lack of ways of how to use it. The current major cost of computing is the programmer. Getting a server to run code is practically free.
