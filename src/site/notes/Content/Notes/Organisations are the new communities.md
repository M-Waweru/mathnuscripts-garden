# Organisations are the new communities

Before capitalism, we lived in close-knit communities that had a similar economic activity. However, the world has changed and we know spend more time in institutions, organisations, companies and so on, than we even do at home. Our children go to schools, we go to work and so on. 

Organisations have become so entrenched in our lives that they are indispensable. We cannot just say that they don't matter. They do because we spend most of our adult life in them. This means that we should take ownership of their organisations. We should be driving them or choosing them very selectively.
