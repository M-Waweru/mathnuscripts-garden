# The Mathnuscripts

Welcome to the Mathnuscripts, the tip of the iceberg of the Digital Mind project.

## Introduction

This is a long-term project to collect the ideas, thoughts and knowledge that I have and nurture them into a comprehensive, navigable and understandable body of knowledge that can be browsed, analysed and presented to others and myself.

The goal is to have this knowledge base as the beginning of something bigger than myself. Something that I will leave behind and benefit other people.

The Mathnuscripts are divided into [[Content/Essays/Index of Essays\|Index of Essays]], [[Content/Notes/Index of Notes\|Index of Notes]] and so on.
