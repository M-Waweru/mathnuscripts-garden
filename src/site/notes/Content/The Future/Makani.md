# Makani

Website on [[Fleeting Notes/X Company\|X Company]]: [here](https://x.company/projects/makani/)

I loved them because of the documentary they came up with. Eventhough it was a total failure and lacked a market, it was great to see the ingeniuty to build something difficult. 

It was wasted time but the time was wasted in the pursuit of a dream. What's not to love?

This [article](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/02/21/rip-google-makani-perhaps-the-entire-airborne-wind-energy-space-will-finally-disappear/)covers the demise of Makani well. It was not commercially viable but it was a good lifestyle venture to flex intellectual and engineering muscle. But the talents of the team could have been used elsewhere with greater productivity.
