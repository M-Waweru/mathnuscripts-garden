# What are the Mathnuscripts

> *As I write, I must do. As I do, I must write*
> - Mathenge Waweru

What are the [[Content/Projects/Mathnuscripts\|Mathnuscripts]]? These are a collection of notes written by Mathenge Waweru. They conceptualise the world from his perspective. What he sees, he writes. What is written is used or stashed. All in all, it serves a purpose. A purpose of self actualisation and a legacy of observation and pondering that will transcend his lifetime. 

They could be a digital mind, a collection of notes, a couples of linking scripts or a library of knowledge. All are valid but miss the bigger story. 
- A digital mind infers that only the author may write to it. This is yet to be determined. Better yet, the Mathnuscripts can take a mind of it's own and generate its own writing.
- A collection of notes. Notes are written word. This is just a drop in the ocean of the media we have at our disposal today. We have audio, images, video, interactive games, software, augmented and virtual reality. There are even 3D models, architecture, engineering and art, which are all expressions of life itself. Notes are merely a means of expression.
- A couple of linked scripts. In truth, I am seeking to link ideas to one another. This is beyond syntax but to semantics. One abstracted ideas connected to another to reveal hidden patterns in thinking. Linked scripts cannot do this yet, something else has to be done.
- A library of knowledge. The study of epistemology and the collection of facts and observations is a good hobby but it is not everything. The important things are often elusive and cannot be expressed as facts. Life is full of emotions, push and pull and ultimately chaos. The order of knowledge is one of encapsulating the world but it is not the full story.

In this dissection, we come to see that the Mathnuscripts is subject to discovery. Even I don't know what it can become but I know that it will be good. It is my secondary legacy. For the primary legacy is in the physical. The Mathnuscripts can only be possible because of the acts I commit in the world. In this human form, I must embark on journey. In this digital form, I must take the reader with me.
