# Index of Essays

Essays are evolving products of my writing. They are a flowing stream of ideas that seek to make a pointâ€”from [[Content/Essays/Why Software is Important\|Why Software is Important]] to [[Content/Essays/Towards Being a Man\|Towards Being a Man]]. Some are also posted on my blog at my official [site](https://mwaweru.com). Enjoy ideas that may last for a long, long while (500 years is the goal).
