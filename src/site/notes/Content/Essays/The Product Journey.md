For anyone who is mildly aware of the tech industry, you will know the big names like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and many others. These companies have generated massive amounts of value for their founders, employees, customers and even affiliates who work with them to provide offering to customers as fully-fledged businesses. They have advanced the progress of information technology by turning this silicon-based tool into a product-generating machine. 

In this blog, I would like to dissect this idea of building a product that generates value for customers and the founders. This is the process of entrepreneurship in our innovation space, focusing on software. However, it is important to note that the technology is more than software, even a hammer is a technology, although an old one. Information technology, which is built on digital computers is just the latest epoch of technological progress in the human story. 

With that said, I would like to borrow inspiration for this essay from this [article](https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/startup/lecture_slides/lecture5-market-wireframing-design.pdf). In Balaji's notes, he quoted an interesting [post](https://www.quora.com/Startup-Strategy-2/As-first-time-entrepreneurs-what-part-of-the-process-are-people-often-completely-blind-to/answer/Mike-Sellers) on Quora that stuck with me. 

An idea is not a mockup,
A mockup is not a prototype,
A prototype is not a program,
A program is not a product,
A product is not a business,
And a business is not profits

This set of steps shows a bird's eye view of how to look at innovation and building products that generate value. Of course, the devil is in the details and each product idea has it's own way of handling these steps. Some require huge investment and great skill, while others can be done from home with a remote team. With software products, you have the advantage of getting through this process faster and easier than a biotech or nuclear fusion startup.

By looking at my own experience at Impact Africa Network, I will show you how we went through these steps, or at least until the stage we have reached and the lessons I learnt.

As a quick comment, it is important to note that each stage requires a different mindset. You can do this by taking up a different role or strategy or hiring someone to lead that process. The best way to do this is by having a good team. This cannot be stressed enough. Alright, let's get started by looking at the idea first, then taking it through the steps. 

## Idea
It all starts with an idea. In many cases, we see a problem and come up with a quick solution to it. We think to ourselves that this can be a great idea for a business. We think about all the features that it could have. This is the natural approach that most people take and it's misleading. Before, you jump into designing a solution, you need to understand why you thought of that solution in the 1st place. We come with solutions based on the tools and experience that we have. For example, we can look at the problem of climate change. A activist would solve this by advocating oil companies to stop selling oil. A scientist will come up with a solution to extract CO2 from the atmosphere. Clearly, the solution they come up with is based on their expertise and what they can do. However, the problem remains the same. At the end of the day, it remains to be seen whose solution reduce the effects of climate change. In order to do this, the innovator in question has to get down to the cause.

In the same example of the activist, their cause of climate change is oil companies selling oil or cars using petrol. He suggests that we get rid of petrol cars and reduce the consumption of oil. That's great until you realise that we hardly have alternative sources of energy to drive our economy. All the cars, trains, ships and planes rely on oil. Telling them to stop consuming oil is unrealistic. Another innovator would consider building electric cars. That would reduce petrol consumption but can it compete on price, that's the challenge to tackle. 

In the end, the innovator who recognises the effects of a problem and seeks to understand the causes, can come up with a solution that works. This requires research. When dealing with a problem that people face in the daily lives, we conduct market research. It consists of talking to customers, researching on existing solutions to tackle the problem and bouncing ideas with other innovators. We can borrow a page from Elon Musk, read books and talk to great people. I will also add talking to your potential customer.

As you look into the idea, you can answer these 3 questions:
1. Is it a problem?
2. Can you build a solution?
3. Are there people willing to pay for it?

These are an initial filter to help you think about your product and what to look.

From experience, it is best to be analytical about it. In our market research, we developed a set of questions to ask our target customers to assess if the problem exists and if they like the solution. It is important to note that investigating the problem allows you to understand how your target customer thinks, their motivations, their needs and also their habits. It may be best to keep the conversation structured with the set of questions but you can ask follow-up questions to nail on an interesting pain-point they have. For example, we would also waiters about how they receive tips but we would end up getting tales about the performance reviews by managers, how they work in shifts, the tough interview process and the high employee turnover rate in some restaurants.

Here is a template to ask questions:
1. Demographic - age, gender, income, role
2. Geographic - country, county
3. Psychographic - lifestyle, personality, values, interests
4. Behavioural - benefits, user status, readiness to buy

Create a Google form or Airtable form to fill in these questions as you talk to customers. With structured data on a spreadsheet, you can surface the frequency of what users are talking about and trace trends in the data. For example, 4 out of 10 people mentioned that they tip waiters often. That's a good insight to present when defending your idea. It can even surface more questions on why the other 6 people don't tip often. That's a new question to ask and track the data come.

In this stage, you are gathering insights and drilling down to the root cause of the problem you are trying to solve.

Mindset: Have an investigative and inquisitive mindset. Look for patterns, trends and facts that can back the problem you want to solve and whether it is worth the hassle.

## An idea is not a mockup
You have all these insights, you have a couple of ideas how you can solve the problem. This is great but now we need to narrow down on how we will solve it.

In this process is a battle of ideas for solutions. It is all about which ideas and perspective shows more promise in solving the problem and why. Most ideas on the solution will not make it to the mockup. 

A mockup is a representation of how the solution will work. It includes user flows, wireframes, design sketches and so on.

Consider this the solidification process where hazy ideas become visual concepts of how the solution will work. 

I have come learn that this is where the fights happen. Each team member has their own idea of how the solution should work. Ideally, each one should have a say in how the product should work but ideas will always clash. Members can get attached to their ideas and will not be happy to see their feature idea getting dropped, ignored or hesitated on being added to the mockups. 

When people request feature ideas, they are imposing their reflection on the product. It is always a good feeling to see your idea noticed and considered. It is a form of investment that gives you initial skin in the game. When you talk about the product, you know that a feature was thought up by you and you will advocate for it. We identify ourselves with the ideas we have, which makes sense why people get demotivated or upset when they are not heard.

Keeping track of all the feature requests made and the reasons behind it is a great way to reduce conflict and speed up this stage. One framework is user stories, which specifies:
1. The user who will use the feature
2. The action they will take
3. What it will help them achieve

For example, as a tipper, I would like to deposit money from my Mpesa account to Shukran, so that I can tip service workers with a Shukran account
1. The user is the tipper
2. The action is depositing money from Mpesa
3. The why is to tip service workers with their Shukran account

For each feature requested, create a user story.

From a user story, you can draw out a user flow. These are steps that the users will take to deposit funds. Specify the clicks they will make, the information they will enter, the output displayed and so on.

For example,

User logs in -> User clicks on Deposit -> User selects deposit method (Mpesa) -> User enters amount to deposit -> User confirms deposit -> User receives PIN prompt -> User enters PIN and confirms -> User receive success message 

Once you have a user flow, you can design sketches of how the user interfaces will look like. The visual components like buttons, text fields, icons and pictures are considered. The basic sketches are wireframes, which have no colour and specify the general placement of components. The next evolution is mockups, which contain the colours, patterns, logo of the site and so on.

Mockups are the closest thing to the product but without the functionality. It shows the user interface for logging in to the platform but it's just an image and no data is stored.
