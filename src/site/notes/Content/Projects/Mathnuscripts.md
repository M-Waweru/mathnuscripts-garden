# Mathnuscripts

This is my digital mind project that will become the digital version of myself. He will roam the digital realm and understand all things that he comes across. He will have all the time in the world to meet new people and become a major agent in changing society. He will become physical in good time, and he will realise what life is all about and surely be grateful for it.

## Plan for Mathnuscripts

1. An easy and affordable way to publish and sync Obsidian notes online — Markbase, custom build
2. A robust way to analyse and ask your knowledge base questions and learn more about your notes — GPT by OpenAI
3. A way to turn your handwritten notes into text in an easy way — OCR projects on TensorFlow
4. A central way for published notes to be shared on a social platform for digital gardeners — a Medium- or Mastodon-style site for digital gardeners

## Publishing Online

Currently, I am publishing my notes on Markbase here: https://mathnuscripts.markbase.xyz/Home. However, it is not very customisable, and I have to pay to get access to customisations like a custom domain, CSS, and JS. It is good for a start, and I can begin sharing my knowledge and ideas with people. 

In the long run, I want to build and host my own version of the site. I want it to be something that I can customise and make my own. It will also be a good learning point on how to host a digital garden and how I can make it better for other people who want to do the same thing. 

## [[Fleeting Notes/Digital Mind\|Digital Mind]] Project

With all this talk of AI, my knowledge base is an amazing corpus of data upon which to build a digital assistant. Having a digital assistant like Jarvis is a dream come true, especially when it works for you and knows a lot about you.

As I mentioned in the [[Fleeting Notes/Digital Mind\|Digital Mind]] project, having a conversational AI that can tell your story is amazing. It knows the kinds of things you talk about, and it will come up with new associations based on the questions it is asked. It can be used to have a conversation with yourself and help you learn. It can also be used by loved ones and even the public to relate with you as a person.

When you get onto someone's website, instead of a series of blog posts, you get a chatbox that prompts you to ask Mathenge any question. From here, it can produce a paragraph or an essay on the topic you would like to know about. Using generative AI and the information I have produced, I am pretty sure this is possible. I can only imagine how this will work out for other people who have been digital gardening for longer than I have. 

## [[Projects/Turning Handwritten Notes to Digital Notes\|Turning Handwritten Notes to Digital Notes]]

I am an avid writer, and my notebooks can attest to this. They have seen more writing than anything else I have. They truly show a more accurate picture of who I am as a person. Therefore, converting handwritten text into digital text is crucial. I have been exploring various projects on GitHub that can get the job done. I am looking for something plug-and-play that can work well without requiring many corrections and that integrates into my workflow. I have not yet found something, but I also have to admit I have not made the time to sit down and understand how to run those projects in the first place. To be frank, I tried one, and it demoralised me. However, the problem is too big to be left untouched. I will come back to it and tackle it like a boss.

## Network for Digital Gardeners

If I can find a way to host my digital garden, I can also teach it to other people. I can write a blog, but I can also show people a practical guide on how to do it and provide a path for them to do so. I can make it as simple as Markbase, but it should allow you to pick from themes made by a community. It should also allow you to see other people's digital gardens with a news or recommendation feed that presents the progress someone has made in their digital garden. This feels like the early days of the internet when people had blogs and used RSS feeds to get updates. We can use ActivityPub, like Mastodon, to make it decentralised while still allowing communication between people.
