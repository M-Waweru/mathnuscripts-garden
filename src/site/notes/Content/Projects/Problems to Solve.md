# Problems to Solve
1. There is so much information on the internet that it is hard to keep track of everything. It gets overwhelming. Refers to [[Fleeting Notes/Managing My Digital Environment\|Managing My Digital Environment]]

	- The problem is too many tabs open.
	- Another problem is too many emails and newsletters
	- There are so many blog posts
	- There are so many videos

		Solution: Have a stash of all this information and have a fun way to go through them. It could be like Stumbleupon but for bookmarks (InfoStash)
		User can organise/summarise and share their stash with other users. (InfoMining)

Refers to [[Projects/Turning Handwritten Notes to Digital Notes\|Turning Handwritten Notes to Digital Notes]] and the [[Content/Essays/Note-taker's Dilemma\|Note-taker's Dilemma]]
