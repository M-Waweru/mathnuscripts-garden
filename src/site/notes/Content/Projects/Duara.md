# Duara
This is the latest idea that Elvis and I came up with. 

Duara is circle is Kiswahili. We chose the name to express how vision to build the global payments system for a hyper-connected world.

We plan to use stablecoins to replace the legacy system of credit cards, which are full of complexity and monopolism.

We plan is help merchants to trade with other countries at low costs and fast settlement times.

In short, we seek to take the power of mobile money to the world. Kenya is a great example of how you don't need credit cards or a bank account to do trade. Very few people actually have a bank account and most of account holders rarely use it for day-to-day payments. 

We use an abstraction of the banking system that utilises mobile technologies like USSD to facilitate the exchange of money.
