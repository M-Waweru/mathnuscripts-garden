# Agriculture
- Africa needs to take advantage of the resources that it has. We have large tracts of arable land but we sit on it. There are many examples of countries that are doing more with less like Israel and Netherlands
- This industry needs to revamp and become the hottest place to work at as an African. 
- Africa will not progress with smallholder farming. We need commercial enterprises to run farms.
- We can train existing people but my focus is on the young, educated population who opt to work for tech or banking because they pay well. I want them to come to agriculture.
- Agriculture is not just about digging. It entails for the following:
	1. Production - growing and harvesting of crops
	2. Processing - this is value addition. For example, turning wheat into Weetabix or barley into beer
	3. Equipment - making hoes, tractors, sensors and so on
	4. Inputs - fertiliser, water, pesticides and herbicides
	5. Financing - getting loans, making payments for stock
	6. Advisory - extension services, education
	7. Distributors - collection and transportation of crop goods
	8. Retailers - selling goods to the consumer
