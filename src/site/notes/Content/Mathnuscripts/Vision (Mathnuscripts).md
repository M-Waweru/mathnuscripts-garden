# Vision (Mathnuscripts)

The `Mathnuscripts` are a lifelong work: an evolving digital mind, a publishable knowledge garden, and a system for turning life into learning.

## Core Intent
- Preserve memory and meaning
- Synthesize ideas across domains
- Share a living body of work
- Build tools that make knowledge useful

## Layers of Evolution
- Archive of Self → Interactive Agent → Narrative Engine → Garden Network
