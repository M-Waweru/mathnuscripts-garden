# Writing User Stories

- _A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer._
- A key component of agile software development is putting people first and user stories put the end user at the center of the conversation
- It is an end goal, not a feature, expressed from the software user's perspective
- The team gets to understand:
	- Why they are building
	- What they are building
	- What value it creates

## Why user stories
1. Stories keep the focus on the user
	- Unlike to-do lists that focus on tasks and their completion, user stories keep the team focused on solving problems for real users
2. Stories enable collaboration
	- With the end goal, the team can work together to decide how to best serve the user and meet that goal
3. Stories drive creative solutions
	- Encourages the team to think critically and creatively about how to best solve the end goal
4. Stories create momentum
	- Stories are small enough to complete in one sprint, giving the development small wins for each story they complete

## How to write user stories
1. Definition of done
	- Define when a user can complete the outlined task
2. Outline subtasks or tasks
	- Specify steps to complete and who is responsible for each
3. User personas
	- 
4. Ordered Steps
	- 
5. Listen to feedback
	- 
6. Time
	- Stories should be completable in one sprint
	- Break a story down if it takes weeks or months. You can also make it an epic

## Template of a user story
"As a [persona], I [want to], [so that]"

1. As a [persona]
	- Who you are building for
	- Give him/her a name like Jack
	- Interview people like Jack to understand how they work, how they think and what they feel
2. [Want to]
	- Describe the intent of the persona and what they are trying to achieve
	- This is not a feature or an implementation, it is the end goal for the user
3. [So that]
	- What's the overall benefit of what they are trying to achieve
	- What is the big problem that needs to be solved?
