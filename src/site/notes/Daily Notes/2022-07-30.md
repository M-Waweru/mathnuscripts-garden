I don't really want to start a blog for Mathnuscripts, my Digital Journal is a gateway to my mind, that's what it is. It is a digital garden that is cultivated, changed and watered. It is everchanging and I am free to do as I please.

I should just get the Obsidian Publishing and stop complaining. This is where I can share my world, in an unrestricted and dynamic way. A journal stream is too fixed, but a folder and even linked structure is what I want. It is a masterpiece that gets better every time. I can open it up, read through a note, edit something small, do the same for other notes and close for the day. With each edit, the scripts get better. That's what I want. People just need to look at my stream of thought, the stories, the wonder of the ideas. They are to inspire. They can include a great many things.
