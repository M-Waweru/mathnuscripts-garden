# A dream that matters to me

Working with the internet and determining the future of how knowledge will be stored would be a fascinating thing to me. It is such a far off dream and very abstract that I cannot see it. I see myself working with my own data center or home-lab. I see myself being this Leonardo Da Vinci figure who is always on the look out for great ideas and working on them. Designing new systems of storing knowledge, flight and so on. Being a polymath that is not limited by anything. How can I become that? Have the liberty to express my curiosity and interest in a wide variety of things. 

It is time that I started playing the long game. Startups are great but they may not be it. Indeed, the world is capitalist and we need to make money in order to survive but how can I do this without fucking up with the creativity and freedom I crave.

This journey should start. Even if it is just a blog where I share my ideas and a group of like-minded people that I can talk to about this stuff. That would be the start of a great dream. A dream that matters to me.
