# Evolving Interests 2023

My interest has been evolving over time and I am glad to see where this is going. The only problem is that my wants are moving faster than what I have produce. I want to a motorcycle but I don't have the money right now to buy one. That's because of poor financial decisions like paying people's bills when I go out and also buying a new laptop for myself since it will be very crucial for my work. My interests are as follows:

1. Computers and startups - for computer is my livelihood, period. Wherever I go, I will have my laptop has my tool of trade. I can write code, write articles, make investments, communicate with teams and so on. That's amazing stuff and a superpower in today's time.
2. Motorcycles - I use motorbikes every day when I go to work. I cannot separate them from my day-to-day. The only problem is that I am driven by other people and that is more costly and less flexible than if I owned my own bike. I want to get my own so that I can travel more, be more independent and more free. I can also just fill my tank at the beginning of the month and not worry about fuel again.
3. Hiking - I enjoy being in the outdoors and running up hills and mountains. Testing the limits of my body and what it can do in the vast terrain. It is different from running or other sports because it has adventure in it. I can explore a new area, climb some rocks and look cool while doing it. I like that. I also like taking pictures.
4. Writing and sharing online - I have been building my digital garden for a while now and I love sharing my knowledge, insights and ideas with people. I enjoy writing my thoughts down and sharing them because it offers me an opportunity to scope out an idea and dispense it uninterrupted by the reader. I enjoy readers, not listeners, because most people are not good listeners anyway. 

Other interests include:
1. Classic cars like the Porsche 356
2. Music - this is something very underrated that I don't talk about much. I love sounds, beats and bass. I would even become a DJ if given the chance. EDM all the way.
