# The Boring Path to $1 Million Net Worth Before 35
## Core Pillars
1. Career
2. Side venture
3. Investing
4. Fitness

## Non-core or Universal pillars
1. Specialisation
2. Geo-diversity
3. Networking

#### 1. Career
- I have no career, I am an Innovation Fellow
- Okay, it is actually a career but it is an entrepreneurs career, which makes it my life

#### 2. Side Venture
- I have no side venture apart from my interest in the blockchain space, which is closely related to my career.
- I have been asked by people to have classes on blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Seems like a lot of admin and anyone can do that
- I should be building but that takes even more work

#### 3. Investing
- I invest in a couple of things:
		1. United Women's Sacco - 5k per month
		2. Crypto - 5k per month
		3. Kuzah - 3k per month
		4. Sile Capital Group - 2k per month
- Looking to get into Degen crypto investing but I am not sure how to get started.
- My goal for the year is 500k in invested and saved assets

#### 4. Fitness
- I am doing extremely poorly on this one.
- I stretch occassionally in the morning and I take a 30 minute walk at least every day
- This needs to improve. I could just pay for a gym membership and make sure that I go

#### 5. Specialisation
- Right now, I have my focus on being a technical product manager
- This means that I manage the development of a product and I oversee the software development side of it. I manage the people who work on the design, business and software side
- Also, I have my eyes set on the blockchain technology. However, it is a bit out of my range of things to get done so I just have Twitter Spaces about it

#### 6. Geo-diversity
- I am not geo-diverse, I have never even worked outside of Nairobi
- I thought of moving to Nyeri back in the university but there is nothing for me to do there

#### 7. Networking
- My networking skills are not the best and I have not attended anything new this year
- I have contacted a number of people in the blockchain space but apart from that, I am a ghost in this Nairobi scene.
