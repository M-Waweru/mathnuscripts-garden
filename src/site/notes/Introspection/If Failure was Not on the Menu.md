# If Failure was Not on the Menu

I have been thinking about what I would do if I knew that I would not fail. I am not sure what that is yet. I want to learn fast before I know what that it. There are a couple of ideas that I can list out:

1. Create a digital version of myself that I can talk to and converse with
2. Build Shukran into a billion dollar bank
3. Tell stories through tech, animation and writing from a new African perspective
4. Start a knowledge book and encyclopedia from Kenya
5. Building a Hacker studio to build small-scale projects with big impact
6. A Tinkerer's life where I earn a living from building things that matter to me

Imagine all the things that I can build, all the books that I can read, all the essays that I can write. There is so much to do that I feel like they are so far away. I don't even believe that I can have them. Imagine if I just started to pursue those things with a passion and I managed to make money out of them. I am working on Shukran right now and it is a great opportunity to learn a lot of principles but it doesn't feel like it is it. There are some things that I want that I cannot explain. I have tried to put them into words but none comes to mind. Maybe I just want to write a book like my digital garden which I have made.
