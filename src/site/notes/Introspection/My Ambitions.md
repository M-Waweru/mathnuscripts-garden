# Ambitions for the Future
My 3 commitment for 2022 are [[Introspection/Pillars for 2022\|Pillars for 2022]]. They are:
1. Product Development - this can be extended to Venture Building
2. Documentation - writing, podcasting, making videos
3. Physical activity - hiking, exploring, travelling

However, there are also my larger ambitions and the pillar above are an start to this journey. They are as follows:

## 1. [[Content/Projects/Agriculture\|Agriculture]]
- Africa needs to take advantage of the resources that it has. We have large tracts of arable land but we sit on it. There are many examples of countries that are doing more with less like Israel and Netherlands
- This industry needs to revamp and become the hottest place to work at as an African. 
- Africa will not progress from smallholder farming. We need commercial enterprises to run farms.
- We can train existing people but my focus is on the young, educated population who opt to work for tech or banking because they pay well. I want them to come to agriculture.
- Agriculture is not just about digging. It entails the following:
	1. Production - growing and harvesting of crops
	2. Processing - this is value addition. For example, turning wheat into Weetabix or barley into beer
	3. Equipment - making hoes, tractors, sensors and so on
	4. Inputs - fertiliser, water, pesticides and herbicides
	5. Financing - getting loans, making payments for stock
	6. Advisory - extension services, education
	7. Distributors - collection and transportation of crop goods
	8. Retailers - selling goods to the consumer

## 2. [[Fleeting Notes/Knowledge\|Knowledge]]
- The internet has been dubbed the information superhighway and it lives up to the name.
- With all this information, it can be overwhelming.
- We need ways to process and understand this information so that it can push us forward as a species.
- By developing ways to turn information into useful knowledge, we can reduce the noise that we receive and allow people to get the knowledge they need to live their lives.
- The internet is a gift but now we need to filter it to cater to our needs, instead of catering to the needs of the attention-seeking platforms and content.
- This involves:
	1. Knowledge Management
	2. Understanding the self
	3. A memex or second brain

## 3. [[Exploration\|Exploration]]
- This is the wilder side that's all about going out into the world and experiencing it for what it is.
	1. Hiking
	2. Running
	3. Biking
	4. Flying airships and paramotors
	5. Diving into the deeps of the ocean
	6. Space-walking
- Experiencing life using the advancements in technology that we have. Pushing the boundaries of what is possible

## 4. [[Visionary Workshop\|Visionary Workshop]]
- There are many smart people that I have met in my life but we are so isolated and hard to come by. 
- I want to bring together smart people and let them go wild with ideas and building them out
- It can be philosophical to technical in nature but it is ideas all the same.
- A place where people get to dream big and see the future and all its possibilities.
- A key point is that there are no expectations for these meetups, hackathons or cerebrations. Just talks, thinking, building and fun times.
