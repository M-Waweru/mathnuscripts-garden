# Community Savings Groups in East & Southern Africa: Prevalence, Tip Management, and Tax Compliance

## Introduction

_Members of a village savings and loan association (VSLA) in Uganda meet to pool their savings in a lockbox. Informal savings groups like this are widespread in Africa – for example, nearly 29% of Ugandan households participate in VSLAs[monitor.co.ug](https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/locals-turn-to-village-savings-groups-as-banks-lose-appeal-4921942#:~:text=often%20run%20by%20and%20for,a%20vital%20financial%20support%20system). These community-based groups go by various names (chamas in Kenya, stokvels in South Africa, etc.) but share a common goal of collective saving and borrowing._


Community-based financial groups have long been a cornerstone of African economies. In East and Southern Africa, informal savings and credit groups enable people to pool resources, access credit, and support each other financially. This report explores these **community group structures** – their history and prevalence, how they might be used to manage tip income for service workers (like waiters and tour guides), the financial services they offer, and strategies to ensure tax compliance for all parties involved. The focus will be on Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa, with a broader look at similar practices in other African countries. The aim is to understand how such groups could remove or reduce tax liability on tips for individuals without falling foul of tax laws, and what alternative approaches exist to stay on the right side of the “tax man.”

## Community Group Structures in Africa: An Overview

**Informal Savings Groups:** Across Africa, informal savings groups are known by various local names but operate on similar principles. Members contribute money regularly (daily, weekly, or monthly) into a common fund and either take turns receiving a lump sum (a **rotating savings and credit association**, ROSCA) or allow the fund to accumulate for loans and joint investments (an **accumulating savings and credit association**, ASCA). These groups often have constitutions or agreements on contribution amounts, meeting frequency, and payout order. For example, in South Africa these clubs are called **stokvels**, an invitation-only savings club traditionally of about a dozen or more people[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokvel#:~:text=Informal%20savings%20syndicate). The term _stokvel_ comes from “stock fairs,” referring to cattle auctions in the 19th century where such rotating savings schemes first took root[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokvel#:~:text=people%20serving%20as%20a%20rotating,3). In Kenya and Tanzania, informal saving circles are commonly known as **chamas** (Swahili for “groups”) or “merry-go-rounds”, and village savings and loan associations (**VSLAs**) respectively.

 

**Prevalence:** These community groups are hugely popular and economically significant in many African countries. In South Africa, it is estimated that **half of adult South Africans are members of a stokvel**, with more than 800,000 active stokvel groups managing around R50 billion (about $3.3 billion) in collective savings annually[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokvel#:~:text=their%20own%20use%2C%20for%20payment,or%20investment%20purposes). Kenya similarly has a strong culture of chamas – according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, chamas (informal investment groups) contribute **over 30% of Kenya’s GDP** through their savings and investments[solve.mit.edu](https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/2024-global-economic-prosperity-challenge/solutions/89255#:~:text=Relevant%20statistics%3A). Surveys indicate approximately **2.5 million Kenyan adults participate in chamas** as members[solve.mit.edu](https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/2024-global-economic-prosperity-challenge/solutions/89255#:~:text=Relevant%20statistics%3A), highlighting how widespread these groups are. In Tanzania, about **18.6% of the adult population saves through informal savings groups** (nearly one in five adults) including VICOBA (Village Community Banks), ROSCAs, VSLAs and SACCOS[carnegieendowment.org](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/01/benefits-and-risks-of-bank-and-savings-group-partnerships-in-tanzania?lang=en#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20World%20Bank%E2%80%99s,4). Other countries show similar trends: for instance, in Uganda, roughly **28.9% of households save via VSLAs** (making it the third most common savings mechanism after mobile money and keeping cash at home)[monitor.co.ug](https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/locals-turn-to-village-savings-groups-as-banks-lose-appeal-4921942#:~:text=often%20run%20by%20and%20for,a%20vital%20financial%20support%20system). These figures underscore that community saving groups are not fringe phenomena but rather a mainstream part of financial life in Africa, especially for those with limited access to formal banking.

 

**History and Cultural Role:** The concept of communal finance is deeply rooted in African communities. In many cases, these groups began as social support networks. In South Africa, stokvels date back to the early 19th century among Black communities – starting as mutual aid societies and evolving into savings clubs for everything from groceries to funerals[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokvel#:~:text=Informal%20savings%20syndicate)[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokvel#:~:text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%20half,R50%C2%A0billion%20in%20stokvels%20a%20year). In Kenya, the chama movement gained momentum in the 1980s during a period of economic hardship. Chamas started largely as **women’s savings groups in the ’80s** when Kenya was cash-strapped, providing a way to pool resources for household needs and businesses[geo.coop](https://geo.coop/articles/how-chamas-and-mutual-credit-are-changing-africa#:~:text=They%E2%80%99re%20groups%20that%20started%20in,round%E2%80%99). Over time, they expanded and now include men and youth; many chamas have grown from simple merry-go-rounds into sophisticated investment clubs that buy real estate, stocks, or vehicles. Tanzania and other East African nations likewise have long traditions of collective savings – for example, **cooperative unions and credit societies** have existed since mid-20th century (in Tanzania’s case, tied to President Nyerere’s ujamaa villagisation policies), and informal “upatu” rotating groups have been passed down through generations. These community structures thrive because they are built on trust, social cohesion, and mutual benefit. They also fill gaps left by formal institutions – providing small loans without collateral, a safe place to save in communities far from banks, and an emergency cushion for members.

 

**Financial Services Offered:** Beyond the basic mechanism of saving and borrowing, community groups often offer a suite of financial and social services to members:

- **Credit and Loans:** Members can borrow from the pooled fund at low interest rates. For example, a VSLA in Uganda might allow members to take a loan at 5% monthly interest – far cheaper and more accessible than a bank or payday lender[monitor.co.ug](https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/locals-turn-to-village-savings-groups-as-banks-lose-appeal-4921942#:~:text=Mr%20John%20Mugisa%2C%20chairperson%20of,rely%20on%20trust%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said). This credit helps members invest in businesses, pay school fees, or handle emergencies. The interest paid usually goes back into the group’s fund (increasing the pot for all members or sometimes distributed as a dividend).
    
- **Insurance and Welfare:** Many groups maintain a social fund for emergencies. A common variant is the **burial society** in Southern Africa – members contribute specifically to ensure funds are available for funeral expenses in case of a death. This acts as an informal insurance policy so that no single family bears the full cost of a crisis. Similarly, groups will often collectively assist a member who falls ill or faces hardship. Such mutual insurance is invaluable in communities lacking formal insurance coverage.
    
- **Investment Opportunities:** Some advanced chamas and stokvels focus on investments. Instead of rotating payouts, they accumulate contributions to invest in assets. In Kenya, it’s not uncommon for a chama to buy a plot of land or start a small business with group funds. In South Africa, there are “investment stokvels” where the group pools money to invest in stocks or unit trusts, later sharing the returns. These approaches let individuals partake in investments that would be out-of-reach individually.
    
- **Savings Discipline and Large Payouts:** For members, being in a group forces a regular savings habit (since peer pressure ensures you contribute on schedule). In ROSCAs, the lump sum payout in one cycle enables a member to make a big purchase or payment they otherwise couldn’t from incremental savings. For example, a hotel housekeeper might use her turn to receive the entire group fund in December, allowing her to pay school fees for the next year all at once, or buy building materials for home improvement.
    
- **Social Support and Networking:** There’s also a less tangible benefit – belonging to a group builds social capital. Members meet regularly (often monthly), which for workers can mean networking, sharing information, and collective bargaining power. In sectors like hospitality, workers within a city might form an association that not only saves money but also advocates for their rights or organizes training workshops.
    

With this context in mind, we will delve into how these community group structures specifically relate to **service workers and tip income**, focusing on Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa, and then discuss the tax implications and compliance measures.

## Kenya: Chamas and SACCOs for Service Workers

Kenya has a vibrant culture of informal group finance. **Chamas** in Kenya range from small groups of friends saving a few hundred shillings a month to large formalized investment clubs with bank accounts and even registered companies. Nearly every Kenyan knows of or belongs to a chama in some form, be it a women’s church group saving for Christmas, a youth group funding a startup idea, or colleagues pooling money for mutual aid. The prevalence is significant – by one estimate, **over 300,000 chamas are registered in Kenya**, involving millions of people[solve.mit.edu](https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/2024-global-economic-prosperity-challenge/solutions/89255#:~:text=The%20scale%20of%20the%20problem,of%20financial%20inclusion%20and%20empowerment)[solve.mit.edu](https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/2024-global-economic-prosperity-challenge/solutions/89255#:~:text=Relevant%20statistics%3A). These contribute substantially to the economy (potentially **over 30% of GDP by mobilizing domestic savings and investments**[solve.mit.edu](https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/2024-global-economic-prosperity-challenge/solutions/89255#:~:text=Relevant%20statistics%3A)). The ethos is summed up by a popular saying: _“kuungana ni nguvu”_ (unity is strength).

 

**History and Structure:** As noted, chamas took off in the 1980s, primarily as women’s initiatives during financially challenging times[geo.coop](https://geo.coop/articles/how-chamas-and-mutual-credit-are-changing-africa#:~:text=They%E2%80%99re%20groups%20that%20started%20in,round%E2%80%99). Traditional banks had high barriers and the informal sector needed capital – chamas met this need. Over time, many Kenyans participate in multiple chamas: perhaps one for basic household needs (a ROSCA giving each member a monthly pay-out), another as an investment club (an ASCA buying assets), and another for welfare (funeral fund). Modern chamas often maintain bank accounts, have elected officials, and even a constitution. Some register as self-help groups or as companies limited by guarantee to give themselves legal standing. Additionally, Kenya has a strong cooperative movement: formal **Savings and Credit Co-Operative Societies (SACCOs)** function similarly but at a larger scale (e.g. teachers, taxi drivers, or hotel workers might each have their own SACCO). SACCOs are regulated and offer services like loans from member deposits, sometimes even ATM cards and dividends on shares.

 

**Service Workers and Tip Management:** In Kenya’s hospitality and service industry (restaurants, hotels, tour companies), tipping is common but typically done in cash informally. If a group of service workers decides to use a chama structure, it could work as follows:

- The employees (say all waiters in a restaurant, or guides in a tour firm) agree to pool their tips (either all of it or a portion) into a common fund. This could be done daily or weekly. For example, each waiter might contribute 50% of their daily tips into the pool, keeping the rest for immediate use.
    
- The pooled tip fund acts like a mini-SACCO for those workers. They could establish rules that every month, the total pooled amount is given to one member (rotationally), or that members can borrow from it for emergencies and then repay, or simply save it for a group goal (like a year-end bonus distribution or investing in something collectively).
    
- **Removing Individual Tax Liability:** By doing this, individual waiters are not **directly taking home the full amount of tips each day** – instead, a lot of that money goes into a group kitty. From a tax perspective, technically any income earned should be declared by the individual, but in practice these tip pools would be off the payroll records. If managed informally, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) would have no immediate visibility of those amounts per person. The waiter’s taxable income (as seen by KRA through their payslip) remains just their official salary (which often is modest in service jobs). The tips, meanwhile, become a collective resource. Should the group later pay a lump sum to a member, it might be seen as a sort of _gift or payout_ from a group effort. Under Kenyan tax law, **payments or benefits received “by virtue of employment” are considered taxable income**africalawcentre.blogspot.com. Tips from customers clearly fall in this category – courts have held that _even tips given to employees in the course of their work are taxable_, as they are essentially rewards for services renderedafricalawcentre.blogspot.com. However, the gray area is that if the money is not given straight to the employee but rather voluntarily given to a fund, one might argue it’s no longer a wage payment at that point. If the fund then uses the money to, say, give a loan to the employee or pay for their child’s school fee, is that taxable income or a loan/benefit? In Kenya, a **genuine gift given out of “pure benevolence” and not as a reward for services is not taxable**africalawcentre.blogspot.com. A tip is _not_ pure benevolence (it’s tied to service), but if converted into a group welfare payout, it starts to look more like a benevolent benefit.
    
- **Financial Services to Workers:** By leveraging a chama, service workers can benefit in several ways beyond just tip management:
    
    - They create a forced savings mechanism, turning sporadic tip money (which might otherwise be spent immediately) into planned savings. This can help them accumulate enough for significant expenses (rent, education, etc.).
        
    - They can extend **small loans** to each other from the pool. For instance, a waiter might borrow from the group fund to cover a medical bill and later repay from future tips. This prevents resorting to expensive shylocks or salary advances.
        
    - Over time, they might invest the group fund. It could be something as simple as opening a fixed deposit at a bank under the group’s name to earn interest, or as ambitious as investing in a side business (maybe the group pools enough to start a small kiosk or buy a motorcycle for a side hustle, generating extra income for members).
        
    - The group provides a social safety net. If one member faces a crisis (e.g. bereavement or illness), the group can agree to give a grant or no-interest loan from the tip fund. This kind of support is highly valued in Kenyan communities.
        

**Tax and Compliance in Kenya:** Kenya’s tax authority (KRA) expects individuals to declare _all income_, including tips or any benefits from whatever source, on their annual tax returns. In reality, enforcement is focused on formal income sources. Cash tips often go unreported. If service workers’ tip chama remains informal and small-scale, it’s unlikely to draw scrutiny. However, if it grows large or if the business’s accounting shows significant sums allocated to a staff fund, KRA could take interest. Officially, **tips should be taxed as part of one’s employment earnings**, and there is legal precedent reinforcing that (e.g., a Kenya Revenue Authority interpretation that a tip is taxable just like wages)africalawcentre.blogspot.com. To ensure compliance yet minimize issues:

- The group could register as an official entity (like a **society or cooperative**). While the cooperative itself might not be tax-exempt, cooperatives in Kenya enjoy some tax benefits (for example, dividends paid out by SACCOs are subject to a final withholding tax of 5%, which is lower than individual income tax rates). If the tip pool were a SACCO, any interest it pays to members might only incur that small withholding, and the principal would essentially be viewed as members’ own savings. This route requires paperwork and adherence to cooperative regulations, but it provides a legal framework.
    
- If not registering, the group should at least keep records. If ever questioned, they can show that money in was either paid out to members as reimbursements or used for mutual benefits, not as undeclared salary. They might characterize payouts as “loans” which are later forgiven or as “gifts.” Notably, if an employer contributes to an employee’s welfare fund as a gift (with no strings attached), it can be framed as a non-taxable benevolence.
    
- The safest approach from a tax standpoint is of course to **voluntarily declare the tip income**. Since many Kenyan service workers are low-income, even if they declared all their tips, they might still fall below the taxable annual threshold (currently around Ksh 288,000 per year tax-free). In that case, there’s no tax due but at least records are clean. The challenge is the administrative burden and the fear of attracting KRA’s attention. A middle ground might be: ensure that each member’s eventual benefit from the group fund stays under the tax threshold or is used for specific non-taxable purposes (like medical expenses, which if paid directly to a hospital might not count as taxable income to the individual).
    

In summary, Kenyan service workers can harness the well-established chama model to pool tips, which boosts their financial security and potentially sidesteps immediate tax deductions on those tips. They should, however, be mindful of the legal standpoint that tips **are** part of gross income and technically reportableafricalawcentre.blogspot.com. With prudent structuring (possibly as a SACCO or welfare group) and by keeping individual benefits modest, this approach can remain in the spirit of the law (helping low-wage earners save) while avoiding trouble with tax authorities.

## Tanzania: VICOBAs and Informal Associations in Hospitality

Tanzania similarly has a rich tradition of cooperative saving. Common models include **VICOBAs** (village community banks), which are essentially community-run microfinance groups, as well as ubiquitous ROSCAs often just called _“upatu”_ or _“kibati.”_ Many of these operate like the Kenyan chamas or Ugandan VSLAs, with weekly meetings where members contribute to a cash box and later take loans or payouts. According to World Bank data, **about 18.6% of Tanzanian adults use savings groups to save money**[carnegieendowment.org](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/01/benefits-and-risks-of-bank-and-savings-group-partnerships-in-tanzania?lang=en#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20World%20Bank%E2%80%99s,4), highlighting their importance for financial inclusion. These groups flourish both in rural villages and urban settings (e.g. market traders in Dar es Salaam might form a daily savings group). The Tanzanian government and NGOs have promoted such groups as a development tool, and there are networks linking them to formal banks. For instance, some banks have products to link with VSLAs so that the groups can deposit surplus funds for safekeeping[carnegieendowment.org](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/01/benefits-and-risks-of-bank-and-savings-group-partnerships-in-tanzania?lang=en#:~:text=The%20innovative%20linkage%20between%20banks,access%20barrier%20in%20the%20bank).

 

**Service Industry Context:** In Tanzania’s service and tourism industry (which is significant, given the draw of safaris and Zanzibar’s hospitality sector), tipping is common – guides, hotel staff, and restaurant workers often receive tips from tourists. Traditionally these are given in cash or through tip boxes at establishments. The idea of a community group for tip management could be applied as follows:

- Employees at an establishment (say a safari lodge or a restaurant) agree to collect all tips into one pot. In some cases, this is already done via **tip pooling** policies – for example, a tour company might pool all tips to be shared among the staff (drivers, cooks, guides) so that even back-office or less-visible staff get a share. This could naturally extend into a savings group format: instead of immediately sharing the tips out, the pooled fund is treated as a group savings scheme.
    
- The group could function as a **welfare association**. Tanzanian labor culture often includes _welfare unions_ within companies where employees contribute a small amount monthly for mutual aid. A tip-based fund could augment that. The money could be used to provide zero-interest loans to members or grants on significant life events (weddings, funerals, etc.).
    
- **Tax Implications:** Tanzania’s tax laws, like Kenya’s, consider income from employment broadly taxable. While specific references to tips in Tanzanian law are not well-publicized, one can infer they are treated as part of taxable income if officially recorded. However, many Tanzanians in the informal sector do not file income tax returns at all, especially if their formal income is below the taxable threshold. Service workers in lodges or hotels might have formal salaries (subject to PAYE withholding), but tips often bypass official records. By funneling tips into an informal VICOBA or ROSCA, those amounts remain off the immediate radar. If the group is not a registered entity, there’s no direct tax on the group’s activities. The risk would come if, for example, a large pooled amount is deposited into a bank account – banks are required to report suspicious transactions and large cash deposits. But if handled in cash or mobile money in small chunks, it would likely go unnoticed by the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA).
    
- To ensure compliance, workers could structure the pool as a **SACCOS**, since Tanzania has a legal framework for cooperatives. If a cooperative is registered, it typically would have a TIN (Tax Identification Number). Cooperatives in Tanzania may receive some tax exemptions (for instance, SACCOS interest income for members used to be tax-exempt up to a point, though laws change). By being a formal SACCO, the group could even negotiate with the employer to perhaps channel a portion of service charges or a fixed tip amount into the SACCO on behalf of employees. The SACCO then handles disbursements as loans or dividends. This way, any tax is handled at the cooperative level if applicable, and employees don’t individually report each tip.
    
- **Financial Services to Members:** A Tanzanian service workers’ group would provide much the same benefits as described for Kenya:
    
    - _Savings accumulation:_ They can save up for big needs (many Tanzanians use December payouts from ROSCAs to buy farm inputs or pay school fees – service staff could do the same with tip pools, essentially treating it as a year-end bonus fund).
        
    - _Credit:_ They could borrow for short-term needs. Notably, interest rates in informal groups are often decided by members – some charge a token interest (e.g. 5-10% per month) to grow the fund; others might not charge among themselves as long as the money is returned. This is far cheaper than the formal micro-loans which can have high interest.
        
    - _Access to formal finance:_ Group membership might eventually help members access banks. There are initiatives in Tanzania where banks open group accounts for VSLAs and after seeing a group’s savings discipline, they may extend a loan to the group. The group can then on-lend to members. Service workers, through their tip fund, could leverage this to perhaps get a larger loan (say to collectively purchase a piece of land or for each member to get a small amount for home improvement) with the bank’s confidence.
        
    - _Collective investments:_ It’s conceivable that, say, a cohort of tour guides form an association and pool not just tips but also some of their wages to invest. For example, they might jointly buy a tour van to rent out, creating a side revenue stream for the group. Tip money can seed such projects.
        

**Practical Example:** Consider a group of 10 safari guides in Arusha who regularly receive tips from tourists after each trip. They create a group (perhaps informally, or register it as “Arusha Guides Welfare SACCO”). Tourists are subtly encouraged to drop tips into a community tip box or electronically send to a group mobile money number, rather than individual handouts. At the end of each month, the total is tallied. Instead of dividing it up then, the guides decide that each month one guide will take a large portion as a lump sum (rotation), and a part of it stays in the SACCO as savings. In the month it’s John’s turn, he might get a payout that’s equivalent to what he would have gotten in individual tips anyway – but because it’s in one chunk, he can do something meaningful like paying college fees. In other months, when he’s not the recipient, his share is essentially being saved in the group. For tax, John’s official salary is taxed via PAYE, but these tip lump sums via the SACCO are not on any payslip. If John is prudent, he might still declare it in his annual return as other income – but if he is below the threshold or if he classifies it as a gift from the group, it might not increase his tax. The TRA is unlikely to audit such a scenario unless the sums are huge or complaints arise.

 

**Compliance and Alternatives:** To avoid any suggestion of tax evasion in Tanzania:

- The employees and employer should ensure transparency internally. If the employer is involved in handling the tip fund (for example, collecting credit card tips and passing them to the group account), they should document that those funds are **held in trust for employees** and not the company’s income. (In many jurisdictions, including Tanzania, a business acting merely as a conduit for tips can avoid treating them as revenue – similar to South Africa’s ruling on this[rsm.global](https://www.rsm.global/southafrica/news/taxation-treatment-tips#:~:text=calculations).)
    
- If there is concern, the group could decide to voluntarily pay a small tax or at least file a return. For example, if their pooled investment earned interest in a bank, paying the withholding tax on interest is straightforward and keeps things compliant. Any **gratuities** drawn from the fund could be framed as “ex-gratia welfare payments”. Tanzania’s tax code does allow some fringe benefits to be tax-free (for instance, certain medical or death benefits). If the group’s money is used in those ways, it’s clearly not income for services but rather mutual assistance.
    
- An **alternative approach** is simply to formalize tips as part of compensation. Some Tanzanian upscale restaurants add a **service charge** (usually 5-10% on the bill) which is then distributed to staff through the payroll. In those cases, the service charge amounts _are_ taxed as part of wages (PAYE), but the base wage might be set lower accordingly. While this ensures full tax compliance, it reduces the net tips employees get (since tax is taken out). It also shifts the model from voluntary tipping to a mandatory fee. This approach might not always be competitive in sectors reliant on the goodwill of tipping, but it’s an alternative that completely avoids any tax ambiguity.
    

In summary, Tanzanian service workers can benefit from communal financial groups in much the same way as Kenyans – improving their financial security and managing tip income – but they should aim to align their practices with at least the letter of the law. By keeping the fund’s use focused on genuine welfare and savings (and possibly leveraging formal structures like SACCOS), they can minimize any legal risks while maximizing the support system for the workers.

## South Africa: Stokvels and Tip Funds in Hospitality

South Africa’s landscape of community finance is highly developed and somewhat unique due to the formal recognition stokvels have. As noted earlier, around **11 million South Africans are active in stokvels**, with an estimated **R50 billion circulating** in these groups annually[ipsos.com](https://www.ipsos.com/en-za/stokvels-remain-untapped-human-banks-south-africa#:~:text=A%20new%20online%20and%20video,in%20the%20South%20African%20economy). Stokvels are diverse – from monthly grocery savings clubs, to birthday societies, to high-end investment pools. There is even a National Stokvel Association of South Africa (NASASA) that oversees and advocates for these groups[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokvel#:~:text=year). Under South African law, stokvels are considered legal and are exempt from some banking requirements as long as they operate within certain limits (they must be genuine rotating or savings schemes, not fronts for pyramid schemes or unlicensed banks). Many banks (like Nedbank, Standard Bank) offer “stokvel accounts” tailored for group access with multiple signatories.

 

**Tip Management via Stokvels:** In South Africa’s restaurant and hospitality sector, tipping is entrenched – it’s customary to tip waitstaff ~10-15%, and occupations like tour guides, hotel porters, hairdressers, etc., also regularly receive gratuities. By law, these tips **are taxable** as part of the recipient’s gross income[peopleware.qlink.co.za](https://peopleware.qlink.co.za/news/industry-news/yes-tips-are-taxable-south-africa#:~:text=Contrary%20to%20what%20some%20people,SARS). SARS (South African Revenue Service) has made it clear that a tip given “for services provided” counts as income and should be **declared to SARS** by the employee[peopleware.qlink.co.za](https://peopleware.qlink.co.za/news/industry-news/yes-tips-are-taxable-south-africa#:~:text=Contrary%20to%20what%20some%20people,SARS)[peopleware.qlink.co.za](https://peopleware.qlink.co.za/news/industry-news/yes-tips-are-taxable-south-africa#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20SARS%20notification%2C,%E2%80%9D). However, how those tips are handled can vary:

- If a tip is given in cash directly to an employee, the onus is on the employee to report it in their annual tax return (the employer isn’t involved in withholding). Enforcement relies on honesty, which means many cash tips likely never get reported, especially for lower-income earners.
    
- If a tip is given via credit card or included on a bill, and the employer then pays it out to the employee, SARS has provided guidance: such pass-through tips do **not** count as “remuneration” for payroll tax purposes[rsm.global](https://www.rsm.global/southafrica/news/taxation-treatment-tips#:~:text=calculations). Employers don’t have to deduct PAYE on them. Still, the employee should self-declare those amounts later[rsm.global](https://www.rsm.global/southafrica/news/taxation-treatment-tips#:~:text=The%20ruling%20given%20by%20SARS,be%20subject%20to%20employee%E2%80%99s%20tax). This ruling (Binding Class Ruling 027) was to relieve employers of the burden of tracking and taxing tips through payroll, while keeping the principle that the individual is responsible for their own tax on tips.
    

Given this framework, consider a group of waiters at a Johannesburg restaurant forming a **tip stokvel**:

- Every day, all tips (cash or card) are pooled. The restaurant might assist by collecting everything and recording it, but instead of disbursing it each shift, they hold it aside for the stokvel. The stokvel (which could be just an informal agreement among the staff, or even registered with NASASA) then manages the funds.
    
- The stokvel could decide to pay each member a fixed “allowance” weekly (to cover immediate needs) and keep the remainder for monthly or quarterly distribution. They might rotate who gets a larger share in a given month, or simply save a chunk for year-end. Some South African groups use a common model where a year’s savings are distributed in December so families have money for the holidays (this is extremely common with grocery and saving clubs).
    
- By doing this, no single employee is directly receiving all of their tip money immediately. From a tax perspective, each employee still technically earned the tips, but practically the money is partly in a communal pot. If at year-end one waiter receives, say, a R5,000 stokvel payout (which originated from many small tips throughout the year), that waiter _should_ declare that R5,000 in their income tax return. However, many may view it as a sort of windfall or club payout rather than taxable wages. In South Africa, there is actually a nuance: if a stokvel is operating as a mutual or common-purpose fund, the payouts to members might be seen as a sharing of collectively owned funds, not new income. Provided the stokvel is not earning taxable income (like interest above certain exemption or profit from trading), SARS historically has not taxed stokvel payouts to members. It’s similar to how lottery winnings or mutual insurance payouts aren’t taxed as income. That said, the original source (tips) was income, so SARS could argue it retains its character as income to the person who earned the tips. There isn’t a well-tested legal precedent of a “tip stokvel”, but one can see how it falls into a gray zone between personal income and mutual club money.
    
- **Financial and Social Benefits:** South African workers forming a stokvel with their tips would enjoy:
    
    - _Equalization of earnings:_ In many restaurants, shifts and sections can cause big variations in tip earnings. A pool ensures everyone (hosts, bartenders, support staff) gets a fair share, promoting teamwork. Many places already practice mandatory tip pooling for this reason. The stokvel is an extension where that pool is then strategically managed, not just split daily.
        
    - _Large lump sums:_ As with other countries, getting a sizable lump sum at once can be life-changing for a low-income worker. It may enable a down payment on a car, a semester’s tuition, or starting a small side business. Stokvels are famous for helping people achieve such goals – members often use their payout to buy appliances, pay school fees, or invest. For example, a group of hotel cleaners might each wait for “their turn” to get the bulk of the pooled tips in a given month – that month’s amount could be several thousand Rand, enough to start building a house back in their village, whereas daily dribs and drabs would have been consumed on daily needs.
        
    - _Credit and purchasing power:_ If the tip stokvel deposits money in a bank account, they could earn interest or even take a group loan. Some banks have reported huge uptakes in stokvel accounts – for instance, First National Bank noted billions of Rand in stokvel deposits as more groups bring cash into the banking system[dailyinvestor.com](https://dailyinvestor.com/finance/86859/one-south-african-bank-sees-r13-3-billion-in-stokvel-inflows/#:~:text=One%20South%20African%20bank%20sees,3%20billion%20by%20December%202024)[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stokvels-south-africa-r50-billion-informal-financial-marketing-group-rkywf#:~:text=Approximately%2011,nationwide%20%3B%20Collectively%2C%20these). For workers, a recorded history of participating in a stokvel can even improve their credit profile (it shows a savings habit). Additionally, stokvels sometimes strike deals – e.g. bulk purchasing agreements with retailers at year-end (common for grocery clubs) or group discounts. A tip stokvel could potentially negotiate with a financial institution to maybe get an investment product or insurance cover for its members at a group rate.
        
    - _Emergency aid:_ In the event a member has an emergency, the stokvel can vote to give that member an advance on their share or a special draw from the fund. South African communities place high value on _ubuntu_ (collective support), and stokvels are often about more than money – they are about solidarity. A service workers’ stokvel might also double as a support group that helps members with non-financial issues (e.g., advocating to management on issues, arranging transportation pools, etc.).
        

**Tax Compliance and Legal Considerations in South Africa:**  
South Africa’s SARS is relatively robust in enforcement compared to many other African countries. However, it also has provisions that acknowledge small informal sector practices. Some relevant points and alternatives:

- As mentioned, SARS _requires employees to declare tip income_, but it **does not require employers to withhold PAYE on tips passed through**[rsm.global](https://www.rsm.global/southafrica/news/taxation-treatment-tips#:~:text=calculations). So one immediate compliance step is for the **employer** to document that they are simply collecting and holding tips on employees’ behalf. If audited, the business can show those monies never became the business’s income (so no VAT or company tax on them) and were paid out to staff. This protects the employer. If the tips go into a staff-controlled stokvel account, the business should ideally not touch that account beyond transferring the funds, to keep a clear line that it’s not company money.
    
- The **employees**, on their part, should ideally each declare what they eventually received. If the stokvel does a year-end payout, each member could include that amount in the “other income” section of their tax return. Now, many service workers in SA might be below the tax threshold (roughly R95,000 annual as of recent budgets) even including tips, so they wouldn’t owe tax. If their income is higher, technically they should pay. One alternative approach floated in some countries (including a proposal in the U.S.) is to _exempt tips from tax_ to benefit low-wage workers[fourth.com](https://www.fourth.com/article/no-tax-on-tips#:~:text=No,excluding%20tips%20from%20taxable%20income). While South Africa hasn’t made such an exemption, being upfront about tips might encourage policymakers to consider relief for this group in the future. It’s worth noting that currently **SARS views tips as part of gross income that must be declared**[peopleware.qlink.co.za](https://peopleware.qlink.co.za/news/industry-news/yes-tips-are-taxable-south-africa#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20SARS%20notification%2C,%E2%80%9D), and there was an Interpretation Note issued (SARS Interpretation Note 76) illustrating scenarios of tip taxation[peopleware.qlink.co.za](https://peopleware.qlink.co.za/news/industry-news/yes-tips-are-taxable-south-africa#:~:text=Schroenn%20cites%20one%20example%2C%20sourced,Gross%20Income%20and%20therefore%20taxable).
    
- **Registering the Stokvel:** NASASA provides guidelines for registering a stokvel. A registered stokvel is recognized as a mutual benefit society. If the tip stokvel registers, it gains legitimacy and possibly some legal protection. Importantly, **income earned by a stokvel (like bank interest) below a certain threshold is exempt from tax**, as these are considered informal mutual schemes. The stokvel itself typically doesn’t pay tax on money contributed by members or paid out to them, because it’s not profit – it’s akin to a partnership of individuals pooling money. As long as the stokvel’s funds are only used for members’ benefit and not as a business to outsiders, it likely falls under non-taxable mutual arrangements (there’s a common law principle in taxation called the “mutuality principle” – you can’t make a profit off yourself; money pooled for mutual benefit isn’t income in the taxable sense until maybe it generates external income).
    
- **Alternatives:** If not using a stokvel:
    
    - One alternative is **direct tip sharing with full transparency**: for instance, each day’s tips are counted, reported, and distributed to staff according to a formula, with each staff member’s share recorded as income. Some restaurants do this through the payroll (especially if tips are large or mostly via card). This way, taxes are withheld (or at least the income is on record). It’s very above-board, but workers may feel pinched by the tax and less motivated if tips feel like just another taxed earning.
        
    - Another alternative is a **service charge system** (like a compulsory 10% added to bills, replacing voluntary tips). That service charge is then divided among staff, usually as part of their paycheck or monthly bonus. This is fully taxable wage income. The advantage is it guarantees extra income for staff and simplifies things (guests know the charge, staff know what they’ll get), but it can have mixed reception. Some South African venues use this for large tables or events, but most still rely on voluntary tipping.
        
    - A creative alternative that some have considered is using a **charitable trust**: in theory, patrons could be asked to contribute to a “Staff Welfare Trust” (which might be registered as a public benefit organization). Donations to such a trust might even be tax-deductible for the donor and the trust’s funds, used for staff welfare (paying for training, hardship grants, etc.), might not be taxable. However, this means staff don’t directly pocket tips – they get indirect benefits. It can raise morale (e.g., the fund might pay for an employee’s child’s education or cover medical bills), but it doesn’t give the immediate reward feeling of a tip. This is more of a long-term welfare approach than a direct earnings supplement.
        

In practice, many South African service workers likely handle tips in a semi-informal way (some pooling, some cash sharing) and only a minority declare them on tax returns, especially if their total income is modest. The key for not getting into trouble is avoiding blatant evasion. Cases that would attract SARS’s ire include a business owner misclassifying normal wages as “tips” to avoid payroll taxes, or very high-earning individuals (say a fancy restaurant’s waiters who might make tens of thousands of Rand in tips monthly) not reporting at all. Those situations can be mitigated by using the stokvel to equalize and perhaps keep each individual’s additional income relatively lower and under scrutiny thresholds.

## Other Countries and Regional Perspective

While Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa illustrate the spectrum from informal to semi-formalized group finance, it’s worth noting that **community savings groups are common across East and Southern Africa**. A few brief examples:

- **Uganda:** As mentioned, VSLAs are extremely common in villages (nearly a third of households use them)[monitor.co.ug](https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/locals-turn-to-village-savings-groups-as-banks-lose-appeal-4921942#:~:text=often%20run%20by%20and%20for,a%20vital%20financial%20support%20system), and even urban workers often have saving groups. Ugandan markets have “sacco” groups for vendors, and boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) riders have pooling schemes. Service workers in Uganda (like restaurant staff in Kampala or lodge workers in national parks) could similarly use these ROSCAs. The concept of “Tontines” (a term more common in Francophone Africa for ROSCAs) is essentially the same mechanism. In Uganda’s case, financial inclusion drives by NGOs have led to tens of thousands of VSLAs being formed, so the culture of group saving is entrenched.
    
- **Rwanda:** Rwanda encourages savings groups too, often calling them _“ibimina.”_ Many low-income workers in Rwanda participate in ibimina for various goals (buying livestock, funding home improvements, etc.). While small-scale in nature, they serve the same role of pooling money for mutual benefit.
    
- **Ethiopia:** The concept of **Equb** is a longstanding tradition there – essentially a rotating saving circle prevalent among traders and workers. Even minibus taxi drivers or waiters in Addis Ababa might run an equb to share tips or surplus daily earnings, getting a turn to take the pot. Ethiopia also has “iddir”, which are more for funeral insurance, showing again the dual aspect of financial and social support.
    
- **Zimbabwe and Zambia:** Similar savings clubs exist (in Zimbabwe often called _“rounds”_ or _“mukando”_ in Shona). Especially during times of economic instability, people turned to these informal systems to hedge against inflation and to access foreign currency. A group of workers might pool tips or small earnings to buy stock of goods or currency. In Zambia, “chilimba” refers to a rotating savings club common among working women in markets and service jobs.
    
- **Botswana, Namibia, Malawi, etc.:** These countries also have local names and versions of ROSCAs and credit groups, reflecting that the model is pan-African. In Southern Africa generally, the term “stokvel” from South Africa is understood broadly even outside SA for any savings club, due to cultural exchange.
    

Across all these countries, the **advantages and challenges remain similar**. The advantage is leveraging community trust to empower individuals financially – which is especially beneficial for service workers who often have irregular incomes (like tips) and can benefit from smoothing out their earnings or accessing lump sums. The challenge vis-à-vis the modern state is that these systems operate largely outside the formal tax net. Governments are aware of the huge sums circulating informally (e.g., that R50 billion in SA stokvels, or Kenya’s chamas influencing a large chunk of GDP). There is interest in linking these funds to formal financial systems (for development and also for eventual taxation or investment). The general approach by authorities has been to **encourage formalization gently** – for example, offering special group accounts, or in Kenya’s case, the government sometimes gives grants or matches funds for registered self-help groups to incentivize them to register. There haven’t been major crackdowns on taxing informal savings because politically and practically it would be very difficult and unpopular to tax what is seen as grassroots self-help money. The focus is usually on taxing the institutions (like banks) or easy-to-monitor points (like if a SACCO invests in a company, that company’s profits get taxed, etc.).

 

For the purposes of **service workers and their tips**, this broader perspective means that using community groups is a path that aligns with cultural norms and is unlikely to draw ire as long as it’s done in good faith. It provides them not only tax relief (de facto) but also financial resilience. However, it’s important that such arrangements are transparent and consensual among the workers, and that they do not contravene any labor laws (for instance, if an employer forces workers to hand over tips to a fund but then mismanages it, that could be a legal issue). Done properly, it can be a win-win: workers benefit and stay out of tax trouble, FinTech companies or banks have an opportunity to serve these funds, and employers foster a cooperative, motivated workforce without bearing extra cost.

## Ensuring Tax Compliance: Strategies and Alternatives

Throughout the discussion, the thread has been how to utilize these community group structures to minimize individual tax liability on tips **without** breaking the law. It’s a delicate balance, because outright tax evasion (simply hiding income) is illegal and risky. Here we summarize key strategies to stay compliant:

- **Understand Tax Obligations:** First, all parties should clearly understand what the law demands. In all three focus countries, **tip income is technically taxable** as part of employment earnings (e.g., SARS explicitly states this[peopleware.qlink.co.za](https://peopleware.qlink.co.za/news/industry-news/yes-tips-are-taxable-south-africa#:~:text=Contrary%20to%20what%20some%20people,SARS)[peopleware.qlink.co.za](https://peopleware.qlink.co.za/news/industry-news/yes-tips-are-taxable-south-africa#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20SARS%20notification%2C,%E2%80%9D), and Kenyan case law treats customer tips as taxable incomeafricalawcentre.blogspot.com). There is no loophole that outright exempts tips in East or Southern Africa at present. So strictly speaking, individuals are obliged to report it. Knowing this, the aim is not to flagrantly violate the rule, but to utilize legitimate frameworks that may offer **tax deferral or relief**. For instance, if tip money is channeled into a registered cooperative that later pays members a dividend, the tax treatment might shift to that of dividends (which can have lower tax rates). Or if the money is given as a loan, it’s not income at all (loans aren’t taxable). By converting the form of the benefit, one can lawfully reduce tax due.
    
- **Use Thresholds and Exemptions:** Many service workers might remain below taxable thresholds when their income is averaged out. In Kenya and Tanzania, there are monthly and annual personal reliefs – ensuring someone earning very low income pays zero tax. If pooling tips means each person’s official taxable pay stays low (and any extra they get occasionally doesn’t push them over the limit), then effectively they are tax compliant (owing zero) even if they had more cashflow via the group. This is a sweet spot to aim for. For example, if a waiter in Nairobi officially earns Ksh 15,000/month (below taxable pay after relief) and gets another maybe Ksh 5,000 in tips via a chama in a good month, their annual still might hover at the edge of taxable range. By careful timing (maybe the chama pays a chunk in January for school fees – a month where tips are lower due to post-holiday slump), they might manage to always stay under the radar.
    
- **Formalize the Group (If Feasible):** Registering the tip pool as a **legal entity** (cooperative, society, partnership or trust) can provide clear legal standing and potentially tax advantages:
    
    - _Cooperative or SACCO:_ In Kenya and Tanzania, cooperatives are taxed differently from individuals. Often, cooperatives pay tax only on profits from external activities, not on distributions of members’ own savings. In South Africa, a stokvel that complies with exemption conditions isn’t taxed on member contributions or payouts. By formalizing, the group can even open a bank account under its name, making transactions easier and safer than handling cash. They should then also file any required returns for that entity, but those might show minimal taxable income if managed correctly.
        
    - _Trust or Welfare Fund:_ Setting up a trust fund for employees (with a trustee committee managing the money) can classify incoming funds as donations. If the trust is registered for public benefit (e.g., an employee welfare fund might qualify if it provides relief of poverty or advancement of something), it might get tax-exempt status. Then when it pays for an employee’s need (like hospital bills), that’s not taxable to the employee because it’s the trust’s spending, not the employee’s income. This method requires legal work and good governance, but it absolutely ensures neither the **FinTechs** facilitating the transactions, the **individuals**, nor the **employer** is seen as hiding income – everything goes through the legitimate charitable channel. The downside is employees don’t directly get cash in hand easily; it’s more for specific uses.
        
- **Leverage FinTech Transparency as a Feature, Not a Bug:** Digital tipping platforms (FinTech solutions) such as Kenya’s _Shukran_ or others provide a way for service workers to receive tips via mobile money or card payments. These platforms often create **verifiable records** of tip income – which might sound like it makes tax avoidance harder. However, this transparency can be used positively. For example, a digital platform could directly route, say, 20% of each tip into a preset savings account or group fund for the worker. This builds a saving habit and an audit trail. FinTech providers could incorporate a feature to generate an annual report of tips earned for the worker, which they could submit to tax authorities. If the government wanted to be facilitative, it could allow an **automatic relief or lower tax rate on declared tip income** to encourage compliance. While such policy doesn’t exist yet, having the data available is the first step to any lobbying for tax relief. In the meantime, FinTech can also help in **splitting tips among group members fairly and instantly** (solving any conflicts about who gets what). They might also partner with micro-insurance or lenders to offer products to those service workers based on their documented tip earnings (e.g., a small loan in the off-season, to be repaid when tourism season (and tips) pick up).
    
- **Employer’s Role:** Employers should be careful not to appear to be colluding in tax evasion. Their best stance is to facilitate the welfare of employees while following the law. If an employer collects tips and puts them into a staff fund, they should regularly disburse or account for those funds (an un-disbursed pool sitting on the company books could be problematic). They should also adhere to any labor regulations – for instance, in South Africa, the Basic Conditions of Employment Act was amended to prevent employers from taking employees’ tips except in a lawful tip pooling arrangement. Transparency is key: tipping policies should be communicated to guests and staff (e.g., “All tips are pooled and managed by the employees’ stokvel for their benefit”). Employers might even consider contributing to the fund as a gesture (like matching a percentage of tips as a bonus), which, if structured as a staff welfare expense, could be tax-deductible for the employer and still not taxable to employees if it goes into the mutual fund. Consultation with a tax advisor is wise before implementing such schemes.
    
- **Documentation and Honesty:** The safest path to avoid trouble is to document and declare where required. If a service workers’ group does something like buy assets (say the Kenyan chama buys a minibus to rent out), they should document contributions and any payouts from the revenue. If members receive profits from such ventures, those are no longer “tips” but investment income – which might still be taxable, but could be offset by expenses or fall under capital gains rules instead of income tax. Proper books can demonstrate the distinction. Also, should any tax authority inquiry happen, being able to show transparent records and that _“we weren’t trying to dodge taxes, we were trying to help low-income workers save and improve their lives”_ can go a long way in getting a favorable outcome or leniency.
    

## Conclusion

Community savings groups – whether called chamas, VICOBAs, or stokvels – have historically empowered African communities by fostering financial inclusion, discipline, and mutual support. In East and Southern Africa, these groups are not only prevalent; they are **integral to the socioeconomic fabric**, mobilizing billions in collective savings[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokvel#:~:text=their%20own%20use%2C%20for%20payment,or%20investment%20purposes)[ipsos.com](https://www.ipsos.com/en-za/stokvels-remain-untapped-human-banks-south-africa#:~:text=A%20new%20online%20and%20video,in%20the%20South%20African%20economy). Leveraging such structures to manage service workers’ tip income is a promising idea that builds on a culturally familiar practice to solve a modern problem: how to maximize workers’ take-home benefits without falling into tax non-compliance. By pooling tips into a communal fund, service employees can smooth out their earnings, access loans and lump sums, and collectively invest in their futures. This approach can **effectively remove or reduce immediate tax liability** for individuals because the income isn’t directly taken as taxable wages, while also providing other financial services like credit, insurance, and investment opportunities tailored to those workers’ needs.

 

However, the line between smart financial planning and tax evasion needs to be carefully respected. The research shows that **tips are considered taxable income in all the focus countries** (as part of gross employment income)[peopleware.qlink.co.za](https://peopleware.qlink.co.za/news/industry-news/yes-tips-are-taxable-south-africa#:~:text=Contrary%20to%20what%20some%20people,SARS)africalawcentre.blogspot.com. Completely ignoring that fact could put individuals, innovative FinTech platforms, or even employers at risk of legal trouble. The recommended path is to use community group structures **in harmony with legal frameworks** – for example, by formalizing groups, taking advantage of any tax-favored treatment of cooperatives or mutual societies, and keeping thorough records. In many cases, service workers’ incomes are low enough that the end result (after using these structures) is still within non-taxable limits, meaning no harm to the revenue authority and great benefit to the workers’ welfare. Where incomes are higher, exploring formal arrangements like taxed service charges or staff trusts might be prudent to avoid future crackdowns.

 

In essence, the tradition of communal saving and sharing in Africa can be adapted to the service industry in a way that **enhances livelihoods and complies with the law**. History shows these community structures are resilient and adaptable – from helping families bury their loved ones with dignity, to purchasing homes and starting businesses. Applying them to manage tip income is a natural next step. It aligns with the broader goals of financial inclusion and social security at the grassroots level. Moreover, it can be a **stepping stone to formal financial integration**: as these tip-pooling groups grow, banks and fintechs can partner with them, and perhaps tax authorities can even create provisions to accommodate and encourage such good practices.

 

Ultimately, the success of this approach will depend on trust and cooperation among all stakeholders – the workers trusting each other in the group, employers supporting the initiative, and authorities recognizing the value of empowering workers. Done right, East and Southern African countries can showcase how blending **indigenous community finance models with modern compliance needs** can lead to innovative solutions that keep everyone (employees, businesses, and the taxman alike) satisfied. The spirit of _harambee_ (pulling together) or _ubuntu_ (I am because we are) that underpins these groups may well be the key to ensuring service workers get their “tip” and keep it too – all within the bounds of the law.
