# Digitalizing Security Registrations

Why do people still use manual registration at gates and offices? Such things should be made digital. There are certain things right now that should have been done by now. People are still so used to the status quo that they don't want to change things that are inefficient.

There should be a form to check this kind of information. The problem is not collecting the information like National ID and phone number, the problem is that you need to verify the person coming in to ensure security. Such a list is good for:

1. Identifying people who come in and out of a place as visitors and where they are going.
2. Have their contact information in case a security policy is breached or for marketing purposes.

What do they need? Fine, they can own this data and export it at any time, however, they cannot export crucial information like phone numbers, emails, national IDs and so on because it doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the individual and the authorities in question. This is a security tool, we are a security company. What does that mean? What regulations would bind us and so on?
