There is a huge opportunity is Government Accountability Tech in Kenya. Keeping the government accountable and upholding democracy.

1. A way to visualise government income and expenditure
2. Tracking of all loans and the projects they were meant to find

The goal is to give people a picture of how they taxes and the loans borrowed in the name of the state are being used or misused in this case.

It also shows all the perpetrators and the best of them all in a leaderboard.

I am inspired by what Rose Njeri did with the tool to send suggestions via email by providing templates and sending the user's behalf. That was good. However, they have decided to prosecute her and make a life difficult, which is sad and just plain pride. They cannot stomach that someone would help people to give feedback. Shameful.
