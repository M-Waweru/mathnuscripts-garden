I want to work on Shukran as a training ground for how to be a great entrepreneur. Once that is done, I would like to sell my stake and move on.

Once it gets to $500M, I want to end up owning 7% of the company, this means that I will get 35M out of this deal. 

I will divide the money into the following things:

1. $10M - Family Office in the US and UK to invest in safe bets. 
	1. Definitely the S&P 500.
2. $5M - Spend on success. 
	1. Buy a home in Nairobi. 
	2. Buy vast land in Nyeri/Nanyuki.
	3. Build a nice car.
	4. Buy property like flats .etc
3. $10M - Angel investing in founders like myself. 
	1. The Hacker Studio.
4. $10M - Build an impossible business.
	1. Nanotech - [[Fleeting Notes/Nanosystems\|Nanosystems]]

In the 1st year, I will cash out $15M. I will invest in the no. 1 and 2. Once that is done, I will continue to work at Shukran to ensure a smooth transition.

If Shukran doesn't make it to $500M and simply becomes a good business, then I will work on increasing my salary and looking to diversify my options.

This will happen after the [[Introspection/5-Year Plan\|5-Year Plan]]
