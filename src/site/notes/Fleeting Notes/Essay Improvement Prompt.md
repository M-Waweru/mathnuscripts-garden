"Here are my raw notes / a draft essay / some rumblings. Please restructure and format them into a clean essay with clear headings and sections. Keep my language, tone, and word choices intact — don’t rewrite my voice, just fix grammar, flow, and formatting so it reads like a finished reflective essay or blog post. No extra ideas, no --- separators between sections. Just polish and structure it."
