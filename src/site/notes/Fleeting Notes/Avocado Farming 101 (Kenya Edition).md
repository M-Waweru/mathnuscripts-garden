# Avocado Farming 101 (Kenya) – A Simple Beginner’s Guide

This guide is for someone brand‑new who wants to understand **what to plant, where, how much it costs, when money comes in, and common mistakes to avoid**. It pairs with the _Avocado ROI Calculator (Kenya)_ in the other canvas so you can tweak numbers for your farm.

---

## 1) What you’re growing (in plain English)

- **Variety:** Start with **Hass** (export favourite). Some farmers also mix **Fuerte** for pollination.
    
- **What the tree needs:** Sun, deep and well‑drained soil, gentle slopes if possible, and water during dry spells (drip irrigation helps a lot).
    
- **How long until fruit:** First small harvest around **Year 3–4**. **Good money** usually starts from **Year 6** onward.
    

---

## 2) Where avocados do well in Kenya

- Altitude around **1,500–2,100 m** (many central & western highland counties work well).
    
- **Rainfall** ~1,000 mm/year (add irrigation if your dry season is harsh).
    
- Soil: loamy, **pH 5.5–6.5**, drains well (no standing water around roots).
    

---

## 3) How many trees per acre?

- **5 m × 5 m** spacing ≈ **150 trees/acre** (fast canopy, more pruning later).
    
- **6 m × 6 m** ≈ **112 trees/acre** (balanced).
    
- **7 m × 7 m** ≈ **~80 trees/acre** (spacious, easier to manage).
    
- Use the calculator to compare densities. More trees ≠ better if you can’t prune and water.

## 4) Simple timeline (what happens when)

**Year 0** – Prepare land, dig holes, add manure/compost, plant certified **grafted** seedlings, fence, set up water.

**Years 1–2** – Care work: watering, weeding, mulching, training/pruning, pest control. No revenue yet.

**Year 3–4** – First fruit. Small income. Keep caring for trees; don’t over‑harvest tiny fruit.

**Year 5–6+** – Trees mature and yields stabilise. **This is when the money gets good.**

---

## 5) Costs & revenue (easy ranges)

**Setup (one‑time, per acre)**

- Seedlings: **KES 200–350** each × trees per acre.
    
- Other setup (holes, manure, irrigation, fencing, tank, labour): **KES 150,000–350,000** total (varies by site).
    

**Annual running cost (per acre)**

- Fertiliser/manure, pruning, weeding, irrigation, basic pest control: **KES 40,000–80,000**.
    

**Prices** (farm‑gate)

- One fruit often sells around **KES 20–40**.
    
- That’s roughly **KES 80–160 per kg** (about 4 fruits/kg). Markets and seasons change this.
    

**Yields** (at steady state)

- A practical middle‑case is **~4–6 tons per acre per year** with decent management.
    

> **Rule of thumb mid‑case:** 1 acre, 5.5 t/acre, at KES 100/kg = **KES ~550,000 revenue per year** once mature.

---

## 6) Example you can copy (mid‑case)

- Spacing: **5 × 5 m** ⇒ **150 trees/acre**
    
- Setup: **KES 250,000 per acre**
    
- Annual opex: **KES 60,000 per acre**
    
- Mature yield: **5.5 tons/acre**
    
- Price: **KES 100/kg**
    

**What this means**

- **Break‑even** typically around **Year 5–6**.
    
- Mature revenue ≈ **KES 550,000/acre/year**.
    
- Per tree at maturity ≈ **KES ~3,700–4,000/year**.
    

Use the calculator to change any number and see how your break‑even moves.



## 7) Step‑by‑step to get started

1. **Check your water** (borehole, tank, river, roof harvest). Trees hate drought.
    
2. **Test soil** (basic pH kit or lab). If pH is off, correct with lime or organic matter before planting.
    
3. **Buy certified grafted seedlings** (avoid random roadside plants).
    
4. **Prepare holes** early (wide, with manure/compost mixed with topsoil).
    
5. **Plant at the right depth** (graft union above soil line). Mulch immediately.
    
6. **Stake young trees** (wind) and protect from livestock/goats.
    
7. **Irrigate** consistently for the first dry seasons; add mulch to keep moisture.
    
8. **Prune lightly** from Year 1 to shape a strong, open canopy.
    
9. **Scout for pests/disease** (scales, mites, anthracnose) and act early.
    
10. **Harvest only mature fruit** (oils up, size right). Immature picking kills your market.
    
11. **Sell smart**: learn your local packhouse schedule and peak price windows.
    
12. **Reinvest** in tools, pruning, and soil health each year.

## 8) Common mistakes (and how to avoid them)

- **Planting without water** → set up storage/irrigation first.
    
- **Planting too dense, never pruning** → crowded, diseased trees and low fruit size.
    
- **Buying cheap un‑grafted seedlings** → poor yields or wrong variety.
    
- **Harvesting immature fruit** → low price today and damaged reputation tomorrow.
    
- **Ignoring soil health** → mulch and manure every year; living soil = healthy trees.

## 9) Quick starter budget (1 acre, mid‑case)

|Item|Estimate|
|---|---|
|Seedlings (150 × KES 300)|**KES 45,000**|
|Other setup (fence, water, holes, manure, pipes, labour)|**KES 205,000**|
|**Total setup (Year 0)**|**KES 250,000**|
|Annual opex (from Year 1)|**KES 60,000**|
|Mature revenue (5.5 t @ 100/kg)|**KES 550,000/yr**|
|**Indicative break‑even**|**~Year 5–6**|

> These are **illustrative**. Use the calculator to fit your land, spacing, and prices.

---

## 10) How to use the calculator

- **Start with 1 acre**, spacing **5×5 m** (150 trees).
    
- Set your **seedling cost**, **other setup**, and **annual opex**.
    
- Choose **first fruit year** (3–4), **maturity year** (6–8), **mature yield** (try 4–6 t/acre), and **price**.
    
- Watch **Break‑even (cumulative)** update. Export **CSV** if you want to share.
    

---

## 11) Mini‑glossary

- **Grafted seedling:** A young tree made by attaching a branch of a good variety (Hass) onto strong rootstock.
    
- **Canopy:** The branches and leaves; shape it so sunlight can reach inside.
    
- **Opex:** Operating expenses (yearly running costs).
    
- **Break‑even:** The year when money in (cumulative revenue) becomes **greater than or equal to** money out (cumulative cost).

### Final thought

Avocados are a **patient crop**. Treat your trees like long‑term partners: water, mulch, prune, protect, and harvest at the right time. The returns build up year after year.
