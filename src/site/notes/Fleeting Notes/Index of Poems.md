# Index of Poems

In this note, you will find a list of all the poems that I care about and read through them to get inspiration and learn something. They have a lot of lessons to unpack, more than what you get a first read. Read them again and again over time and the lessons reveal themselves. Enjoy!

- [[Poems/Stopping in the Snow\|Stopping in the Snow]]
