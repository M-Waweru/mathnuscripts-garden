*“If you hold a gun and I hold a gun, we can talk about the law. If you hold a knife and I hold a knife, we can talk about rules. If you come empty-handed, and I come empty-handed, we can talk about reason. But if you hold a gun and I only have a knife, then the truth lies in your hand. If you have a gun and I have nothing, then what you hold in your hands isn’t just a weapon, it’s my life.*

*The concepts of law, rules, and morality only hold meaning if they are based on equality. The harsh truth of this world is that when money speaks, truth goes silent, and when power speaks, even money takes three steps backwards. Those who create the rules are often the first to break them for rules are chains for the weak and tools for the strong.*

*In this world, anything good must be fought for… The masters of the game are fiercely competing for resources, while the weak sit idly waiting to be given a share.”*
