# When a Man Knows His Destiny is Greatness

When a man knows that he is destined for greatness, he need not worry. He must flow to where destiny leads, following his heart and staying convicted. He must see the world not as it is, but as it can be. With unwavering optimism, he must work to the best of his ability—and then some more.

He must cultivate his vision like a garden—nurturing it, feeding it, and protecting it from decay. He must weed his life of bad habits, people, and thoughts consistently. He must keep his people close but not so close that their voices drown out his own.

He must listen to his enemies and use their spiteful words as fuel for his progress. He must willingly step into life’s problems, risk failure, and run into the fires of life—knowing that the best things in life are born from risk.

He must enjoy the fight—not for the hope of victory, but for the reward of the fight itself. The joy is not only in winning, but in continuing to fight another day. He must win as though it were his destiny to win, and he must lose as though it were good to lose for a change.

He must take life willingly, for it is the only one he has. He must live not for the approval of his creator, but for the joy of living itself. And when he stands before his creator, may he say that he lived a great life—one of duality, balance, and gratitude—for the brief opportunity to play this game of life.

May he walk through life without excuses, for he knows himself and the finiteness of life. He moves gracefully, neither controlled nor brought down, for only the soul experiences these things, and his soul is his to keep.

May he hold both good and evil in his heart—integrated in harmony and ready to be used if need be.  

May he use his good to create love, peace, and harmony around him.  

May he hold his evil to unleash terror, chaos, and death if the world demands it.  

Yet, even with both within him, may he choose good—not out of fear of punishment, but from pure kindness and love for his neighbor.

Let him not strive to be a good man, but a great one. For he _is_ his destiny, and it calls to him all the days of his life—and beyond.
