# The Organization Is the Product

Whenever we talk about startups, the conversation always circles back to _the product_. That magic thing you build once, then sell infinitely. Apps, devices, software — they scale. But there’s something most founders miss: the **organization itself is the real product**.

Products are a reflection of how well the organization is built. A strong organization ships good work repeatedly; a brittle one eventually cracks, no matter how brilliant the initial idea. And unlike code, organizations are made of people. People don’t “scale”; they **grow** — incrementally, organically. They aren’t machines; they are plants. Building an organization isn’t about assembling cogs — it’s about cultivating a garden.

## People Grow Like Plants

When you build products, you think in terms of exponential scale. When you build people, you accept organic timelines.

- A plant doesn’t grow faster because you demand it.
    
- A plant doesn’t bloom because you send it angry emails.
    
- A plant doesn’t yield fruit if the soil is poor or the roots are neglected.
    

People are the same. They need clear purpose, real support, a culture of trust, and leaders who protect them from chaos. When those conditions exist, they produce fruit — in business: innovation, loyalty, recurring revenue, and compounding value.

The role of the entrepreneur isn’t just invention — it’s cultivation. You’re not only a builder. **You are a farmer.**

## You Cannot Overpay for Talent

One of the most useful insights from David Senra’s _Founders_ is blunt and true: **you cannot overpay for talent**. Great companies are built by great people. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Jim Simons, Jensen Huang, Enzo Ferrari — different eras, same obsession: attract the best and keep them. The point isn’t pay-to-play; it’s **invest-to-win**.

Jim Collins captured it in _Good to Great_: first, **get the right people on the bus**. Direction becomes easier when excellence sits in every seat. Hiring isn’t filling roles; it’s planting seeds. When the right person appears, you invest — because their growth becomes the company’s growth.

## The Fallacy of People as Bottlenecks

Too many leaders still talk about people as _cost centers_ or _bottlenecks_. Some even fantasize about a company run by contracts, code, and AI alone.

They forget something obvious: **they themselves are people**. That’s the hypocrisy — visionaries dismissing the very labor that makes their visions real.

Economics is straightforward: output depends on land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. Labor is foundational. If people are that critical, why treat them like expenses? Mismanage this truth and you get toxicity, churn, and collapse.

---

## Hubris vs. Legacy

Extractive leaders think they’re winning by squeezing teams — longer hours, lower pay, fear-driven cultures. It looks efficient in the short term. In the long term, it’s rot: your best people leave, your culture hollows out, and your product quality erodes.

The founders who build legacies take a different path: **you cannot build something that matters by treating people like trash**. If you’re serious about endurance, you nurture the soil, water the plants, and protect the grove. Otherwise you’re playing for headlines, not history.

## The Entrepreneur as Farmer — With Real Numbers

In Kenya, agriculture doesn’t blanket every inch of land — but it remains central, contributing roughly **~20–22% of GDP** and employing a huge share of our people. [Central Bank of Kenya](https://www.centralbank.go.ke/2024/08/13/agriculture-sector-survey-of-july-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Kenya National Bureau of Statistics](https://www.knbs.or.ke/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2024-25-Kenya-Census-of-Agriculture-Pilot-Survey_1.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) The land teaches patience and compounding.

Consider the **Hass avocado**. It starts modestly, then turns into a perennial cash generator if you plant well, space well, and wait. Typical guidance puts first fruit at **year 3–4**, with _economic_ returns after **year 6**. [Wikifarmer](https://wikifarmer.com/library/en/article/avocado-harvest-yield-per-hectare-and-storage?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Standard spacing like **5m × 5m** yields about **150 trees per acre**. [Farming in Kenya | Farming in Kenya](https://farminginkenya.co.ke/hass-avocado-farming-in-kenya/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) A Hass fruit commonly weighs ~**200–300 g**, so ~**3–5 fruits per kg** — we’ll use ~**4 fruits/kg** as a practical midpoint. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hass_avocado?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Fruty Green](https://frutygreen.com/en/how-much-does-a-hass-avocado-weigh-2/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Below is a clean, mid-case model that’s easy to grasp (assumptions are stated; your actuals will vary by agronomy, rains, pests, and market access):

### 🌱 Avocado Economics — Patience Pays

**Assumptions (mid-case):** 150 trees/acre; price **100 KES/kg** (from your 20–40 KES per fruit ≈ 80–160 KES/kg; midpoint used); initial setup **250,000 KES/acre**; annual opex **60,000 KES/acre**; yield ramp aligned to common extension guidance (first fruit year 3–4; economic gain year 6; mature yields ~**2.8–5.5 t/acre**). [Wikifarmer](https://wikifarmer.com/library/en/article/avocado-harvest-yield-per-hectare-and-storage?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

|Year|Yield (t/acre)|Revenue per Acre (KES)|Revenue per Tree (KES)|Cumulative Balance (per Acre)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|0.0|0|0|**–250,000** _(setup)_|
|3|0.5|50,000|~330|–380,000|
|4|1.5|150,000|1,000|–290,000|
|5|3.2|320,000|2,130|–30,000|
|6|3.6|360,000|2,400|+270,000|
|8|4.5|450,000|3,000|+1,000,000|
|10|5.5|550,000|3,670|+1,930,000|
|12|5.5|550,000|3,670|+3,010,000|

**What this means:**

- **Break-even ~Year 5–6.**
    
- From there, a mature acre throws off **~0.55–0.60 M KES per year** in this mid-case.
    
- **Per tree** at maturity: **~3,700–4,000 KES/year** on a tiny annual upkeep — exactly the kind of patient compounding you want from a living asset.

And this is the point: **employees are your trees** — avocado, macadamia, coffee, tea. You are the farmer who wakes early to water, prune, protect. It’s in your best interest that your “trees” are well-fed (fair pay), rooted in good soil (culture), bathed in sunlight (vision), and protected from pests (toxic politics). Do that, and the fruit keeps coming.

_Side note, cultural beat:_ as **Amerix** keeps reminding Kenyans on X, “Everybody wants to be a politician; few want to be farmers. We must become farmers.” The metaphor holds for companies too.

## Revenue per Employee — The Corporate Avocado

This farming logic shows up in the numbers of top tech companies: one great “tree” (employee) can yield **millions** in revenue. The exact figures shift each year, but the order of magnitude speaks for itself.

- **NVIDIA:** FY2025 revenue **$130.5B**; headcount ~**29.6k** ⇒ on the order of **$4M+ per employee**. [NVIDIA Newsroom](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[CSI Market](https://csimarket.com/stocks/NVDA-Revenue-per-Employee.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Apple:** FY2024 revenue around **$391B**; headcount ~**161k** ⇒ roughly **$2.4M per employee**. [Bullfincher](https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Alphabet (Google):** 2024 revenue reported ≈ **$350B**; employees **~183k** ⇒ roughly **~$1.9M per employee**. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Macrotrends](https://macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOGL/alphabet/number-of-employees?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Meta:** 2024 revenue and **74,067** employees ⇒ on the order of **~$2.3M per employee** in 2024–2025 snapshots. [Meta Investor](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[StockAnalysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/meta/employees/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

(For fast-moving AI outfits like OpenAI or Midjourney, public estimates vary wildly month-to-month; the pattern is the same: **multi-million revenue per employee** in growth phases. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-hits-12-billion-annualized-revenue-information-reports-2025-07-31/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[SEO.AI](https://seo.ai/blog/how-many-people-work-at-midjourney?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Interpretation:** just like a mature avocado tree pays for itself many times over, a well-supported, high-impact employee returns multiples of their cost — every single year. Patient cultivation beats short-term extraction.

## My Own Style of Leadership

I admire great entrepreneurs, but I also want a leadership style that fits who I am.

I love solving technical problems that create real-world impact. I want to meet customers, understand them, and build relationships. I enjoy working with smart, hungry people toward a mission that matters.

But I also want a life: time for family, a few deep friendships, side projects that bring joy (and sometimes become products). I want to invest in young people and give them room to achieve their dreams. I want to be remembered not just as a founder, but as a **good leader, a good friend, a good father and husband**.

That only works if I lead in a way that **honors people**.

## How You Treat People Matters

When I left Shukran, I told Mark one thing: **“How you treat people matters.”**

It matters more than your strategy deck. More than your roadmap. More than your funding round. In the end, companies are just groups of people. And people — not profits, not processes, not products — are what make or break you.

This is leadership’s universal law: **take care of people, and they will build with you**. Treat them poorly, and however clever your idea, the collapse is only a matter of time.

## Closing Thought

A company is more than product, process, or profit. It is, fundamentally, about people.

The organization is the product. Build it like a farmer tends a garden — patiently, carefully, with humility. Plant wisely, nurture relentlessly, and when the harvest comes, it will keep giving for years.
