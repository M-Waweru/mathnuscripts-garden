# Attention, Attention, Attention

When a young apprentice asked his master what was the most profound wisdom that he could give him, the master paused for a while in deep thought. He then picked up a stick and draw on the ground one word, Attention.

The student was confused, "What's it?". "Attention", the master said. "I was expecting more", said the student. "Attention, attention, attention". The master continued.

Attention, attention, attention

Too often, we don't realise the incredible power we have in every situation. Your attention is what matters. How you give and withdraw it is what keeps you grounded in control.

Attention is the real currency.

What do you think makes social media platforms money? Attention, attention, attention

What do you think makes companies sell more? Attention, attention, attention

What do women want most from men? Attention, attention, attention

Your attention is the real gold. You can either use it to enrich yourself in all aspects or you can give it away cheaply and watch it get wasted by those who did not deserve it.

When you finally realise that you can rein in your attention into your being and withdraw it from everywhere else, you will benefit from the compounding of your own self-care. Building your business, building a great body, acquiring assets, getting knowledge and experience and being free to choose.
