# Transcendent Mind

I remember when our computer studies teacher (Andrew Karani) in high school made us watch the movie [[Fleeting Notes/Transcendence\|Transcendence]]. It was a fascinating story about a brilliant guy who was trying to tackle the question of Artificial General Intelligence. He gets into an accident and he is dying. There is no way to save him. However, his wife comes up with an idea to save him by uploading his mind into a computer. They spend days and nights trying to figure this out and then it works. He is uploaded onto a computer. However, he is not the same person. This thing that has been uploaded into the computer sounds like the guy but he has different views about the world. He wants to change the world, not understand it. He eventually gets onto the internet and finds a remote town where he can build his empire. In my view, it is more like a laboratory that he is using to build new technologies, cure diseases and solve difficult problems. He is in the zone in this place. Although he does controversial things like mind control and experimentation on the weak and vulnerable, he is a great example of what I am trying to do with the [[Fleeting Notes/Digital Mind\|Digital Mind]]. 

By uploading my thoughts into my computer, I am paving the way for an intelligence that can consume this knowledge and learn from me. It may not be like me as I have my own experience that cannot be fully uploaded, however, by typing on my keyboard, I am giving it as much as I can. There are also other ways I can start uploading my thoughts onto my computer. 

Firstly, I can start a podcast and just talk about certain things that I come across. 

Secondly, I can also make videos and animations that can be watched by people and represent my ideas to the public in a well-thought out and curated manner. 

Thirdly, I am building a knowledge base on Obsidian that can be traversed like networked digital brain and digital garden. 

Fourthly, I can just talk to people more by engaging in debates and sharing my ideas with a community of like-minded individuals. At the end of the day, the traditional way to store information was in other people's heads, through stories and facts.
