Based on this video on Youtube: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUJe0Wmfo5g)

Some students at MIT designed and built an automated kitchen that cooks meals in less than 3 minutes. This would be a gamechanger in hospitality if you could have a fully-automated kitchen that cooks your food. 

It would also be great if it could make cocktails since I usually get frustrated at places like Nairobi Street Kitchen that take long to get you a drink. By using a vending machine model, you can easily get a beer or a cocktail very quickly by a push of a button.

To automate a bar, since I like to drink, I would have to understand how they take stock of their drinks inventory and see how I can improve it even further.
