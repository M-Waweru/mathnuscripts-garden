Today I just learnt about approval-based voting and I can see how it can be a better system than the others. It is clear the first to post voting or voting for one person is actually a poor way to vote people in because it consolidates power to 2-parties. By having a preference-based voting system where you select the candidates that you like, without ranking them in any way, you can actually produce great results and put the right people in power. There is no need to choose a certain party so they can defend your interests against another party. You don't need to worry about spoilt votes.
