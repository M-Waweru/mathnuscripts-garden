# Quick and Hard Changes in Government

We tried to get a PSP license from CBK but we were shot down so fast. They ghosted us and we didn't even know why. It has been 18 months since then and I can still feel the pain. It was a harsh one indeed. However, when working with the National Bank of Rwanda, it has been a different story. The truth is that Rwanda wants fintechs and Kenya feels like it has too many of them. However, even Nigeria has many fintechs, why is this a problem in Kenya, where it is feels like a privilege to get government services.

It is clear that a lot of things need to change in our country. 

1. CBK should have a sandbox like CMA that allows people to test out their fintech solutions. This is clearly a whole fintech, which can provide the infrastructure, capital and know-how on being a fintech. That would be amazing.
2. The Ministry of Lands should have been digitised a long time ago. Why this has not happened is clear impunity and needs to stop. It is complete bullshit why we should have some thugs in government who are stealing in broad daylight.
3. All government services should be digitised. From record-keeping, financial management, payments etc. Everything should be like Estonia.
4. Government should be downsized drastically and all departments must have strategic plans, which are funded based on previous performance. The worse you perform, the less funding you get. There will be a nation-wide All-Hands, where Ministries and department present what they have done for the whole nation to see.

Government needs the following things: Innovative-mindset, Swift and efficient digitisation, Ruthless accountability. With this, we will see a nation that will finally start working. If it means shouting at people on public television, then so be it.
